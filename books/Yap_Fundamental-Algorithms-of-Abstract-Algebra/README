		(where n=0,1,2,...,14)
	- The title page is in ll.dvi.gz and ll.ps.gz.
	- 3/6/2000: I have now included the updated postscript files
		(found under l<n>.ps.gz).

3. You may use the contents here for evaluation of the book,
	or if you are a student, or if you already own a hardcopy of
	the published book (it is convenient to have an e-copy even when
	one has a hardcopy).

4. If you use this book for teaching purposes I would appreciate
	your feedback.

5. I would appreciate hearing from you for comments, errors and typos.
	[NOTE: Since the book has been published, "minor" errors and typos
	 in this download version should not be reported.] 

6. This ftp directory has been available since 1990.
	-- Most of the dvi files (with minor updates)
		here are from approximately 1992.
	-- Since 3/6/2000, I have also posted the postscript files
		that are rather close to the published book
		(at least before the copy editors started to transformed
		my chapters).  The dvi files, however, are unchanged.
