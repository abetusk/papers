<h2 class=toc_omit>Abstract and Introduction</h2>

<p>Most music theory books are like medieval medical textbooks: they
contain unjustified superstition, non-reasoning, and funny symbols
glorified by Latin phrases.  How does music, in particular harmony,
<em>actually</em> work, presented as a real, <em>scientific</em>
theory of music?

<p>The core to our approach is to consider not only the
<em>Physical</em> phenomena of nature but also the
<em>Computational</em> phenomena of any machine that must listen to
and make sense of sound, such as the human brain; by adding this
computational approach to that of the physical, heretofore unexplained
phenomena of harmony simply fall out, that is, are suddenly derived in
a straightforward manner.  In particular we derive from first
principles of Physics and Computation the following three fundamental
phenomena of music:<ul>

<li>the Major Scale,

<li>the Standard Chord Dictionary, and

<li>the difference in feeling between the Major and Minor Triads.

</ul>

<p>While the Major Scale has been independently derived before by
others in a similar manner as we do here [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 300</span>], [<span
class="cite">Birkhoff1933, p. 92</span>], I believe the derivation of
the Standard Chord Dictionary as well as the difference in feeling
between the Major and Minor Triads to be an original contribution to
science and art.  We think our observations should convert
straightforwardly into an algorithm for classifying the basic aspects
of tonal music in a manner similar to the way a human would.

<p>We also examine the theory of the heretofore agreed-upon authority
on this subject, 19th-century German Physicist Hermann Helmholtz
[<span class="cite">Helmholtz1863</span>], and show that his theory,
while making correct observations, and while qualifying as scientific,
fails to actually explain the three observed phenomena listed above;
Helmholtz isn't really wrong, he just fails to be really right.  The
failure of the theory of Helmholtz as an explanation for harmony is
made starkly clear by a simple observation that has somehow heretofore
gone unacknowledged: his theory says that notes are in "concord"
because the sound playing them together is "less worse" than the
playing together of notes that are in less concord; but this theory is
only <em>subtractive</em>, that is, additional notes can only
penalize, some merely less than others, and so the most harmonious
sound should be a single note by itself(!) and harmony would not exist
as a phenomenon of music <em>at all</em>.  Yet harmony does exist, and
does so because people experience harmony as <em>adding</em> something
beyond the playing of a single note; this additive nature of harmony
is easily explained by our theory.  We also consider the more recent
and more computational theory of Terhardt [<span
class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>] (and others) and show that,
while his approach (and, it seems, that of others following in his
thread) also attempts a computational explanation and derives some
observations that seem to resemble some of those of the initial part
of our analysis, we seem to go further.

<p>I intend this article to be satisfying to scientists as an original
contribution to science (as a set of testable conjectures that explain
observed phenomena), yet I also intend it to be approachable by
musicians and other curious members of the general public who may have
long wondered at the curious properties of tonal music and been
frustrated by the lack of satisfying, readable exposition on the
subject.  Therefore I have written in a deliberately plain and
conversational style, avoiding unnecessarily formal language; Benjamin
Franklin and Richard Feynman often wrote in a plain and conversational
style, so if you don't like it, to quote Richard Feynman, "Don't bug
me man!"

<h1 id=sec_1_0_0>1&nbsp; The Problem of Music</h1>

<p>People push different keys on a piano; some combinations and
patterns sound good; others do not.  How does that work?  Looking at a
piano, it is laid out in the following pattern (w=white, b=black)

<p style="text-align:center" ><img
src=my_keyboard.png alt="[My keyboard.]" /></p>

<pre style="text-align:center">
<strong>... wbwbw wbwbwbw wbwbw wbwbwbw ...</strong>
</pre>

<p>Hmm, the white and black keys <em>mostly</em> just alternate, yet
these alternating regions last for 5 and then 7 keys and then that 5/7
region-pair repeats, and where these regions meet there are two
adjacent white keys.  There seems to be a pattern, but it is quite an
odd one.

<blockquote><em>The piano keyboard seems really weird and
ad-hoc.</em></blockquote>

Doesn't it seem that something as simple as sound should have a simple
device for producing it?

<p>Further, this weirdness is not specific just to the piano: the key
layout reflects the Major Scale [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale">maj</a>] which is the
basis of all Western music.  Is that black-white pattern somehow
fundamental to sound and music itself?  Or are they really just a
cultural coincidence, combinations of sounds that we have heard over
and over since infancy and been trained to associate with different
emotions?  Is something fundamental to the ear and to sound itself
that is going on here or not?

<h2 id=sec_1_1_0>1.1&nbsp; Modern "Music Theory" Reads Like a Medieval Medical Textbook</h2>

<img style="float:right" src=mehegan_first_page-1959.png
alt="[First page of Lesson 1 of Section 1 of Book 1 of
[Mehegan1959].]" />

<p>These questions have bothered me literally for decades (starting
when I was about ten, looking at our piano keyboard and asking
"what?!"; I basically wrote the above <a href='#sec_1_0_0'>Section 1</a> "The Problem of Music"
at that time).  Consulting "music theory" never helped me either, as

<blockquote><em>Reading a music theory book is like reading a medieval
medical textbook: such books are full of unjustified superstition,
non-reasoning, and funny symbols glorified by Latin phrases.
</em></blockquote>

<p>For example, here is the first page from a famous book on Jazz
Theory, "Jazz Improvisation 1: Tonal and Rhythmic Principles" by John
Mehegan [<span class="cite">Mehegan1959</span>].  Recall, this is
<em>the first page of Lesson 1 of Section 1 of Book 1</em>, the very
first thing the student reads!

<blockquote>"Each of the twelve scales is a frame forming the harmonic
system."</blockquote>

<p>What is a "scale"?  Where do they come from?  For what purpose are
there or how does it emerge that there are <em>twelve</em> exactly?
What is a "harmonic system" and what does it mean to say a scale
"frames" it?

<blockquote>"Diatonic harmony moves in two directions: Horizontal and
Vertical."</blockquote>

<p>Really?!  They both look pretty diagonal to me.  Oh, but it's
Diatonic!  That sounds Latin so I guess these people are smart.

<blockquote>"By combining these two movements... we derive the
scale-tone seventh chords in the key of C."</blockquote>

<p>What is a "chord"?  What is a "key"?  <em>WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT!</em>

<p style="clear:both">You can't start a science textbook like
that. You have to start with simple observations humans can make.  You
have to build up complex structures from simple ones. You have to
motivate your distinctions.

<p>Even if you say "A chord is 3 or more notes played together" that's
also almost the definition of a "key" as well; for what purpose do we
have this distinction?  You could say "well the notes of a key are
played together but not at the same time," but that also is true of an
arpeggio-ed chord; again what's the distinction?  Even if you say "a C
major chord is C-E-G" there is no motivation as to how it is that
C-E-G sound good together and other combinations of notes do not.

<p>This "music theory" reminds me a bit of Richard Feynman's
description of a science textbook he reviewed for the California
school board as told in '"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!":
Adventures of a Curious Character', [<span class="cite">Feynman1985,
p. 270-271</span>], (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>For example, there was a book that started out with four pictures:
first there was a wind-up toy; then there was an automobile then there
was a boy riding a bicycle; then there was something else.  And
underneath each picture it said, "What makes it go?"

<p>I thought, "I know what it is: They're going to talk about
mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how
the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles
work."

<p>It was the kind of thing my father would have talked about: "What
makes it go?  Everything goes because the sun is shining."  And then
we would have fun discussing it:

<br>"No, the toy goes because the spring is wound up," I would say.

<br>"How did the spring get wound up?" he would ask.

<br>"I wound it up."

<br>"And how did you get moving?"

<br>"From eating."

<br>"And food grows only because the sun is shining.  So it's because the
sun is shining that all these things are moving."  That would get the
concept across that motion is simply the <em>transformation</em> of the
sun's power.

<p>I turned the page.  The answer was, for the wind-up toy, "Energy
makes it go."  And for the boy on the bicycle, "Energy makes it go."
For everything, "<em>Energy</em> makes it go."

<p>Now that doesn't <em>mean</em> anything.  Suppose it's "Wakalixes."
That's the general principle: "Wakalixes makes it go." There's no
knowledge coming in.  The child doesn't learn anything; it's just a
<em>word</em>!

</blockquote>

<h2 id=sec_1_2_0>1.2&nbsp; What is a Satisfactory, <em>Scientific</em> Theory?</h2>

<p>Further, a scientific theory of something is expected to have a
certain "explanatory power".  But what is "explanatory power"?  Is it
just whatever we like?  Consider the old explanations of disease; here
is one: evil spirits inhabit you [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession">dem</a>].
Well, did anyone ever <em>see</em> these spirits?  Were the
experiences of these spirits universal across human kind?  Where there
some general rules of how the spirits behaved?  How many there were?
What would appease them?

<p>Another theory was Humorism [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism">hum</a>]: that there were
four different fluids in the body: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and
phlegm; when they got out of balance, you had a disease.  Ok, this is
better than arbitrary spirits, but did anyone measure the relative
levels of these fluids?  Could someone predict sickness by observing
these fluids get out of balance?  Could you make someone better by,
say, draining blood from them?  "Treatment" based on this theory seem
to have been long practiced, but did anyone <em>measure</em> to see if
draining blood <em>really</em> made people better versus a control
group that did not have their blood drained?

<p>Now we have an new theory called modern medicine. It is much more
complex, but let's take a subset of it: there are little creatures
called bacteria that live everywhere. Certain kinds can live in your
body and the results of their activity, such as their excretions, get
your body out of normal working order, and thus you become sick. If
you give chemicals to a person that are more toxic to the bacteria
than the person, does the person get better?  Yes [<a
href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-do-antibiotics-kill-b"
>Mobley-antibiotics</a>] !  Even when compared to a control group?
Yes!  Can we <em>see</em> these little bacteria in a microscope? Yes!
Ok, this is much more satisfactory as a scientific theory.

<p>Now, let us step back and consider what makes us more satisfied
with this theory.  What is going on such that it is a better theory?<ul>

  <li>For one thing, the theory is <em>mechanical</em>: we have some
mechanism, consistent with our understanding of inanimate matter today
(physics and chemistry) such that the operation of the mechanism
corresponds with what we observe (Scientific Method) [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">sci</a>].

  <li>Further, this mechanism is <em>deterministic</em> and
<em>precise</em>: there isn't much arbitrariness in the mechanism: we
can compute rather well how sick someone will get and how much toxin
we have to give them to kill the bacteria and not the person.

  <li>This mechanism is <em>universal</em>: there is no appeal to
beliefs or cultural norms: people throughout the world get sick in the
same way and the medicines work on them, with but small differences
that can be further explained by another mechanism called genetics.

  <li>This mechanical explanation is <em>simple</em> and
<em>minimal</em> (Occam's razor) [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">occ</a>].  We can
see the parts working.

  <li>Lastly, the mechanism is <em>factored</em> -- made up of
independent parts -- and the complexity of the observed phenomena is
<em>emergent</em> -- arising naturally from the operation of the
parts.  That is, these parts of the explanation of disease all operate
independently: (1) how the body works such that the bacterial
excretions disrupt it, (2) how bacteria works such that the toxin
kills it, (3) how the toxicity to the human depends on the size of the
human, etc.

</ul>

<p>Physicist Richard Feynman gave a series of lectures where he
attempted to encapsulate the basic nature of how science is done and
the kind of results it produces; these were published as "The
Character of Physical Law" [<span
class="cite">Feynman1965</span>]. Here is a brilliant paragraph on how
to know when you have finally found the truth.  [<span
class="cite">Feynman1965, p. 171</span>] (underlining added, not in
the original):

<blockquote>

One of the most important things in this 'guess -- compute
consequences -- compare with experiment' business is to know when you
are right. It is possible to know when you are right way ahead of
checking all the consequences. <span class="emph">You can recognize
truth by its beauty and simplicity</span>. It is always easy when you
have made a guess, and done two or three little calculations to make
sure that it is not obviously wrong, to know that it is right. When
you get it right, it is obvious that it is right -- at least if you
have any experience -- because usually what happens is that <span
class="emph">more comes out than goes in</span>. Your guess is, in
fact, that something is very simple. If you cannot see immediately
that it is wrong, and it is simpler than it was before, then it is
right. The inexperienced, and crackpots, and people like that, make
guesses that are simple, but you can immediately see that they are
wrong, so that does not count.  Others, the inexperienced students,
make guesses that are very complicated and it sort of looks as if it is
all right, but I know it is not true because the truth always turns out
to be simpler than you thought.

</blockquote>

<p>Using Computer Science terminology, I summarize Feynman's point as
follows.

<blockquote><em>The more <span class="emph">factored</span> a theory
and the more <span class="emph">emergent</span> the observed phenomena
from the theory, the more satisfying the theory.</em></blockquote>

<p>The Ptolemaic [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">ptol</a>] model
of the solar system puts the earth at the center. This explanation
really <em>does</em> explain the movements, especially when epicycles
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle">epi</a>] are added,
but it is rather complex and ad hoc: how does it emerge that we need
epicycles? The Copernican [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism">cop</a>]
system is also another explanation of the solar system that puts the
sun at the center. This second explanation only requires Newton's laws
of motion plus gravity. The <em>consequences</em> of Newton's laws are
complex and even hard to simulate, even on a modern computer, but the
<em>laws themselves</em> are quite simple and independent and
mechanical and factored and observable etc. Even further, the
<em>notation</em> used in this theory easily reflects the underlying
<em>understanding</em> in the theory: it allows for easy calculations
when making predictions of the theory. All in all, the Copernican
system is quite a quite satisfying explanation, or theory, of the
motions of planets in the solar system because, not only does it
explain the observed phenomena, it is <em>factored</em> into simple
parts and the observed phenomena are <em>emergent</em> from the
interactions of those parts. Consequently, we use the Copernican
system today (adjusted for relativity and other more recent
observations).

<h2 id=sec_1_3_0>1.3&nbsp; Music "Theory" is Not a Scientific Theory of Anything</h2>

<p>Music "theory" as we find in books today contains <em>none</em> of
the properties of a modern theory that we find satisfying.  At the
start we are presented the odd white-black-white-WHITE-black keyboard
or Major Scale <em>as a given</em>.  We are sometimes told for example
that the Major Scale comes from the Ancient Greeks.  We are sometimes
told it is arbitrary and it only sounds good because we have heard it
since childhood.

<blockquote><em>Nothing in music "theory" counts as a scientific
theory of anything.</em></blockquote>

<p>We are told that certain combinations of notes sound good; these
combinations are called "chords" and the fact that these combinations
sound good is also arbitrary.  We are told lots of strange names for
intervals between notes and these names make no sense.  The Standard
Chord Dictionary of common chords simply consists of a list of note
combinations we are told are good to play together and will feel a
certain way when heard.  Nowhere is there any notion of how we would
predict the feeling each chord engenders from the construction of the
chord.

<p>Sometimes I have encountered vague explanations offering "pairs of
notes having low whole-number ratios" as the reason some notes sound
good together and then told no one really knows how that works.  In
<a href='#sec_5_0_0'>Section 5</a> "Helmholtz Fails to Explain Harmony" we address a well-known
theory of Helmholtz where he attempts an explanation of how it is that
notes with frequencies that are in low whole-number ratios to one
another should sound good together. We will show that his theory has
problems.

<p>If we make any attempt to actually compute note ratios, the
notation actually gets in the way of our understanding: The notation
for the notes and their distances really does not convey very well the
actual ratios of the notes.  For example, in the Major Scale,
sometimes going up to the next one (space to line above it or line to
space above it) goes up one whole "step", a ratio of
2^<sup>(1/6)</sup> = 1.122 (the sixth root of 2), and sometimes only a
"half-step" (or "semi-tone"), a ratio of half as much
2^<sup>(1/12)</sup> = 1.059 (the twelfth root of 2).  (For more on
logarithms and exponentials, see <a href='#sec_3_2_2'>Section 3.2.2</a> "Using Logarithms to Visualize Distances Between Tones/Notes".)  (To those unfamiliar with
musical notation, we will explain the numbers later.)  The difference
between these whole and half steps can only be discerned by looking
way over to the left of the page of music and doing complex
computations with sharps and flats in order to compute the "key" of
the music; and <em>that</em> whole process is designed to defeat the
sometimes-half/sometimes-whole steps (for the arbitrary key of C) that
is baked into the notation itself.  This notation may make music easy
to play, but it does not make it easy to understand.

<p>This music "theory" has all the properties of preventing
understanding, not promoting it.  It fits the description of
pseudo-science pretty well.  Let's try to do better.

<h2 id=sec_1_4_0>1.4&nbsp; Can we Make a Satisfactory Theory of Music?</h2>

<p>I simply refuse to believe that something so fundamental to human
life and so satisfying to so many people is so arbitrary and so
un-explainable.  I have attempted to come up with something better and
I think I have succeeded.

<p>As we build up this theory, we want to make sure that we make as
few assumptions as possible, and that these assumptions are founded
upon actual experimentally-derived facts -- just as we now demand of
the rest of science.  In particular we would like a real,
<em>scientific</em> theory of music to be universal and not appeal to
cultural relativism that says "it's all just arbitrary"; no
explanation that says such things is a real scientific theory of
anything.

<p>Given that <ol>

<li>sound and instruments exist in reality and

<li>music only sounds like something because a human brain is
  computing the listening to it,

</ol>it seems therefore that <ol>

<li>physics and

<li>computation

</ol> respectively seem the appropriate place to start with a real
theory of music.

<p>The brain is central to our theory.  Not knowing how the brain
really works, we therefore have a hole to fill in our explanation.  We
proceed by telling a story to explain the known properties of music;
along the way we assume certain <em>conjectures</em> about the
structure of the brain where we need them.  We make these conjectures
as reasonable as possible, given the assumption that

<blockquote><em>The brain is a machine optimized by evolution to
compute human survival.</em></blockquote>

<p>That is, being a machine, the brain is likely to be subject to
properties that computer scientists and engineers have observed across
many computational systems and that these properties will be driven by
evolutionary optimization. In the end, the test of our theory will
depend on (1) how well it explains the observed phenomenon called
music, and (2) how well the conjectures hold up under testing. In this
essay we do (1) and we leave (2) for future work by cognitive/brain
scientists.

<h2 id=sec_1_5_0>1.5&nbsp; Physical Science: Harmonics Everywhere</h2>

<p>Physical science is about as rock-solid of a theory of the world as
anything.  This is a good place to start.  Catherine Schmidt-Jones [<a
href="http://cnx.org/content/m12413/1.11/">Schmidt-waves</a>]:

<blockquote>

For the purposes of understanding music theory, however, the important
thing about standing waves in winds is this: the harmonic series they
produce is essentially the same as the harmonic series on a string. In
other words, the second harmonic is still half the length of the
fundamental, the third harmonic is one third the length, and so on.

</blockquote>

<p>We can either compute or observe (using, say, high-speed cameras)
the properties of the stable vibrations that occur when a string or or
a column of air is excited:<ol>

<li>There is one frequency (the "fundamental") at which the string or
air will vibrate;

<li>there are also other vibrations (the "harmonics" or "overtones")
having higher frequencies that are multiples of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
etc. times the fundamental at which the string or air will also
vibrate.

</ol>

<p>These harmonics can be demonstrated by two people hold a long
jump-rope: (1) If they swing the rope slowly, the whole rope makes a
single wave. (2) However if they go twice as fast and out of phase
(one goes up while the other goes down) then half of the rope will be
up and the other half down and the positions of up and down will
switch twice as fast; further the very middle of the rope will not
move at all (a "node"). (3) A similar effect happens with three waves
if they go even faster. For a picture, see [<a
href="http://cnx.org/content/m12413/1.11/">Schmidt-waves, Figure
2</a>].  When a string is plucked, <em>all</em> of these waves are
happening at the same time. That is, plucking generates all waves, but
only those the frequency of which divides the length of the string
will bounce back and forth and re-enforce each other and persist;
other frequencies will die out. From [<a
href="http://cnx.org/content/m12413/1.11/">Schmidt-waves</a>]:

<blockquote>

In order to get the necessary constant reinforcement, the container
has to be the perfect size (length) for a certain wavelength, so that
waves bouncing back or being produced at each end reinforce each
other, instead of interfering with each other and cancelling each
other out. And it really helps to keep the container very narrow, so
that you don't have to worry about waves bouncing off the sides and
complicating things. So you have a bunch of regularly-spaced waves
that are trapped, bouncing back and forth in a container that fits
their wavelength perfectly. If you could watch these waves, it would
not even look as if they are traveling back and forth. Instead, waves
would seem to be appearing and disappearing regularly at exactly the
same spots, so these trapped waves are called standing waves.

</blockquote>

<p>We will call each single sine-wave at a single frequency a "tone",
whereas the collection of frequencies that occur together due to a
single physical process (such as a vocal utterance or the striking of
a piano key) we will call a "note". (A tone can be expressed simply as
(1) a wave "frequency" in Hertz (Hz), the number of cycles per second,
(2) a wave "amplitude", the wave peak height, and (3) a wave "phase",
where the wave is in its cycle compared to other waves; we won't
discuss amplitude and phase much.)

<p>This sequence of tones forming a note is called the "Harmonic
Series" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonics">har</a>] or
"Overtone Series" of the fundamental.  Herein we speak of "the (ideal)
Harmonic Series" when we mean an abstract computational ideal and
speak of "an overtone series" when we mean what is actually produced
in reality by a particular actual instrument (which may be quite
different from the ideal); note that others quoted here may not follow
this same convention. (Further, throughout we pluralize "series" as
"series-es" because in a technical discussion it is very important to
avoid the ambiguity between a single series of multiple tones and
multiple series-es of multiple tones.)

<p>There are two conventions for numbering overtones/harmonics; we use
the convention where the fundamental or "Root" tone is called
"harmonic 1", the tone vibrating twice as fast is called "harmonic 2",
the tone vibrating three times as fast is called "harmonic 3", etc.

<h3 id=sec_1_5_1>1.5.1&nbsp; Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series</h3>

From "This is Your Brain on Music" by Daniel J. Levitin [<a
href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">Levitin2006, p. 43-44</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>The timbre of a sound is the principal feature that distinguishes
the grow of a lion form the purr of a cat, the crack of thunder from
the crash of ocean waves,....  Timbral discrimination is so acute in
humans that most of us can recognize hundreds of different voices.  We
can even tell whether someone close to us -- our mother, our spouse --
is happy or sad, healthy or coming down with a cold, based on the
timber of that voice.

<p>Timbre is a consequence of the overtones....  When you hear a
saxophone playing a tone with a fundamental frequency of 220 Hz, you
are actually hearing many tones, not just one.  The other tones you
hear are integer multiples of of the fundamental: 440, 660, 880, 1200,
1420, 1640, etc.  The different tones -- the overtones -- have
different intensities, and so we hear them as having different
loudnesses.  The particular pattern of loudnesses for these tones is
distinctive of the saxophone, and they are what give rise to its
unique tonal color, its unique sound -- its timbre.  A violin playing
the same written note (220 Hz) will have overtones at the same
frequencies, but the pattern of how loud each one is with respectively
to the others will be different.  Indeed, for each instrument, there
exists a unique pattern of overtones.  For one instrument, the second
overtone might be louder than in another, while the fifth overtone
might be softer.  Virtually all of the tonal variation we hear -- the
quality that gives a trumpet its trumpetiness and that gives a piano
its pianoness -- comes from the unique way in which the loudnesses of
the overtones are distributed.

<p>Each instrument has its own overtone profile, which is like a
fingerprint.  It is a complicated pattern that we can use to identify
the instrument.  Clarinets, for example, are characterized by having
relatively high amounts of energy in the odd harmonics -- three times,
five times, and seven times the multiples of the fundamental
frequency, etc.  (This is a consequence of their being a tube that is
closed at one end and open at the other.)  Trumpets are characterized
by having relatively even amounts of energy in both the odd and the
even harmonics (like the clarinet, the trumpet is also close at one
end and open at the other, but the mouthpiece and bell are designed to
smooth out the harmonic series).  A violin that is bowed in the center
will yield mostly odd harmonics and accordingly can sound similar to a
clarinet.  But bowing one third of the way down the instrument
emphasizes the third harmonic and its multiples: the sixth, the ninth,
the twelfth, etc.

</blockquote>

<p>Besides introducing us to timbre, Levitin points out:

<blockquote><em>Most real instruments systematically produce tones
having <span class="emph">amplitudes</span> distinct from that of the
ideal Harmonic Series.</em></blockquote>

<p>Michael O'Donnell points out that the effects of timbre on the
overtone series goes even further [<span class="cite">O'Donnell, 14
January 2009</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>I suggest that you check into the importance of approximate
harmonic series. E.g., the overtones on a piano string are measurably
and audibly higher in frequency than the harmonics that they
approximate. Both the nearness to harmonics, and the perceptible
difference, appear to be important....

<p>You mentioned the way that the harmonic series of frequencies
occurs naturally in air columns, as in strings. But, on soft strings
(such as guitar, violin---little resistance to bending) the natural
series of resonant frequencies is very accurately harmonic. In wind
instruments, the natural resonances of the air column approximate the
harmonic series rather poorly. In the brass, the approximation is so
poor that the numbers of the harmonics don't even match between the
natural resonances and the notes as played. While the conical shape of
many reeds is designed to improve the harmonicity of the resonances,
the bell on the brass is actually designed to increase the
inharmonicity of the natural resonances, which produces a better match
in the misaligned overtones.  It is phase locking between vibrational
modes, caused by the highly nonlinear feedback in the excitation
mechanisms (reeds, lips, bow scraping) that makes the overtone series
so accurately harmonic, not the natural resonances.

</blockquote>

<p>That is, O'Donnell points out:

<blockquote><em>Most real instruments systematically produce tones
having <span class="emph">frequencies</span> distinct from that of the
ideal Harmonic Series.</em></blockquote>

<p>Therefore whatever our theory of harmony it should work for sounds
where the overtone series differs from the ideal Harmonic Series by
(1) altered amplitudes and (2) altered frequencies.  However, notice
that both of these distortions of the ideal Harmonic Series have one
important property:

<blockquote><em>The distortions made by the overtone series of a given
instrument to the ideal Harmonic Series are a predictable, systematic
function of the instrument kind.</em></blockquote>

<p>That is, two notes (series-es of overtones) made by the <em>same
(kind of) instrument</em> will be distorted from the ideal Harmonic
Series in the <em>same (or similar) way</em>.  This must be the case
in order for an instrument or instrument kind to have a uniform,
recognizable timbre.  We will use this below.

<h2 id=sec_1_6_0>1.6&nbsp; Computational Science: as Fundamental as Physical Science</h2>

<p>I think part of the reason the theory we develop here might not
have been described before is that there aren't many people who think
about <em>both</em> the physical <em>and</em> the computational
understanding needed to derive it.

<blockquote><em>The properties, or laws, of computation are just as
fundamental as the physical laws.</em></blockquote>

<p>Computation is everywhere -- you live in a sea of it. <ul>

  <li>You may see a cup, but computational engineers see an idiom for
  managing liquids by getting them stuck in a local optimum.

  <li>You may think of ownership as a basic human right, but engineers
  think of it as an distributed decision-making algorithm.

  <li>You may enjoy a field full of bumblebees pollinating flowers, but
  engineers enjoy it as information distribution network.

  <li>You may think it is polite to not talk on top of other people at
  dinner, but engineers think it is optimal to use a back-off algorithm
  to resolve a network packet collision.

</ul>

<p>I wrote that list off of the top of my head as fast as I can type
and edit text: the examples are myriad.

<p>Consider for a moment that perhaps <em>you</em> are computation:
that you are the computational activity of your brain.  Some people
say that this reduces the wonder of life to simple mechanism; I say it
simply elevates mechanism to the wonder of life.  While you need not
adopt this All-Is-Computation point of view as your personal
understanding of life or of yourself, a computational understanding of
the brain has amazing explanatory power, so please consider it at
least for the rest of this essay.

<h3 id=sec_1_6_1>1.6.1&nbsp; Algorithms are Universal</h3>

<p>Finding good ways to solve a problem with less resources is a basic
pursuit of those who study computation. A general method for solving a
problem is called an "algorithm"[<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">alg</a>]. New algorithms
that solve common problems well are rare and highly valued. When a
solution is "reduced to the simplest and most significant form
possible without loss of generality" we say it is "canonical" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical">canon</a>]. An algorithm
is a canonical method.

<p>Many tricks in engineering seem not to be merely the artifacts of
human cleverness, but instead the result of <em>fundamental</em>
properties of the medium of computing. Algorithms invented by
different species to solve the problem called staying alive often
resemble each other in ways that cannot be explained by any other
means than "that's the only way to do it" (or one of only a few ways).
From [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish">cutt</a>]:

<blockquote>

The organogenesis of cephalopod eyes differs fundamentally from that
of vertebrates like humans. Superficial similarities between
cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of
convergent evolution.

</blockquote>

<p>The human eye and the cuttlefish eye both address the problem of
extracting information at a distance from light. Both evolved
separately and yet they both end up at a very similar solution.
Biologists call this phenomenon "convergent evolution" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">conv</a>];
architects call it "timeless pattern" [<span
class="cite">Alexander1979</span>]; storytellers call it "archetype"
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype">archetype</a>];
clothiers call it "classical style"; computer scientists call it
"algorithm".  When humans tried to find a mechanical solution to the
same problem, they invented the camera which is just an eye again. We
should therefore not be surprised if

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture One</strong>: Computational
laws/idioms/patterns/algorithms are universal: The brain works using a
combination of simple computational algorithms of which we are likely
already aware.</blockquote>

"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way."  -- Jessica Rabbit [<span
class="cite">Jessica-bad</span>]

</blockquote>

<p>Jessica Rabbit [<span class="cite">Jessica-pout</span>] is one of
the sexiest characters in Hollywood, elected 88th of The 100 Greatest
Movie Characters of All Time by Empire Magazine [<a
href="http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=88"
>Jessica-great</a>].  Sadly, she is just a drawing and a voice.
Despite the powerful illusion to the contrary, we do not see or hear
the world; we see and hear the world that our brains compute.  Like
the characters in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" [<span
class="cite">WFRR-1988</span>], we live in a cartoon.  Music is not
what the world does; it is what we do with the world.

<p>A friend of mine Joel Auslander used to intern at Pixar; his job
was to make physics simulator tools for the animators. He wanted to
make simulators that were accurate to the real physics, but he said
that the animators told him that people don't want to watch <em>real
physics</em>, people want to watch <em>cartoon physics</em>: even
though not accurate as real physics, cartoon physics is somehow more
satisfying [<span class="cite">Auslander, c. 1996</span>].

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Two</strong>: The brain uses cartoon
physics, that is, physics that is easy to compute, but not necessarily
faithfully accurate to reality.</blockquote>

<p>We suggest that both the use of cartoon physics and the inaccuracy
of cartoon physics are due to the simple fact that the brain is
computationally limited.

<p>Here is a cartoon physics effect in vision. When taking a drawing
class our teacher pointed out some useful visual effects to us: (1) To
make an object look round, shade the object the more its face bends
away from the viewer and (2) put highlights where the light source
would reflect off of it. Now think what pantyhose do to women's
legs. (1) When the mesh of the hose is straight on, it is not very
dark, but as the leg bends away and the mesh is seen on edge, the
threads line up and the grid rapidly appears to darken. (2) Pantyhose
are shiny and so naturally produces reflection highlights. That is,
pantyhose fire the recognizers in your brain for the features of
roundness harder than a real round leg could: her leg looks rounder
than round, impossibly round.  See <a href='#sec_2_5_0'>Section 2.5</a> "Recognition: Feature Vectors" for more on this phenomenon.

<p>We suggest that the brain is using cartoon physics when processing
sounds as well. That is, explanations of auditory effects based on the
physical properties of <em>actual</em> overtones of different
instruments (such as the piano or the trumpet) are beside the point
(or at least beside the primary point) when it comes to the brain.  As
we will see in <a href='#sec_5_0_0'>Section 5</a> "Helmholtz Fails to Explain Harmony", this
point of view is the essential point where our theory differs from
that of Helmholtz.  What primarily distinguishes this essay from
previous attempts to explain music is that our whole approach is
oriented primarily not from the external world of physics, but from
the internal world of the computation by our brains that is us, from
the computational cartoon in which we live and from which we think we
experience the world, but which is not the world, but instead only
ourselves.

<h2 id=sec_2_1_0>2.1&nbsp; Searching for Harmonics</h2>

<p>As Levitin pointed out in <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series", finding the difference between what
we hear and the ideal Harmonic Series is a valuable tool for
recognizing people and determining their emotional state. Many sounds
are made by vibrating strings or columns of air, but perhaps more
importantly, the human voice is made up of vibrating "chords" and a
"windpipe" of air. Given that sounds associated to a single source
would tend to be arranged in a Harmonic Series, and especially given
how important the voice is to humans, it would not be surprising if
perhaps

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Three</strong>: Finding harmonics is a
common and important problem, so the brain has hardware for
recognizing the Harmonic Series.</blockquote>

<p>You can hear a demonstration of this, and of many other interesting
auditory phenomena, on from the "Auditory Demonstrations" CD from the
Institute for Perception Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands and the
Acoustical Society of America [<span class="cite">acoustical-demo,
Demo 1</span>], "Cancelled Harmonics":

<blockquote>

[Twenty tones in the same Harmonic Series are all played together.]
When the relative amplitudes of all 20 harmonics remain steady (even
if the total intensity changes), we tend to hear them holistically.
However, when one of the harmonics is turned off and on, it stands out
clearly.  The same is true if one of the harmonics is given a
"vibrato" (i.e. its frequency, its amplitude, or its phase is modulate
at a slow rate).

</blockquote>

<p>I recall my voice teacher Andrea Fultz saying the goal was to get
me to sing so that my voice resonated in my "mix": in both my head and
chest voice at the same time [<span class="cite">Fultz,
c. 2006</span>].  She was trying to get me to have a more ringing or
sweeter voice by making sure all the overtones were present by
ensuring that somewhere in my body some resonator of the right size
was amplifying it (see <a href='#sec_2_3_0'>Section 2.3</a> "Harmony: Sweetness is the Ideal"
below).

<h3 id=sec_2_1_1>2.1.1&nbsp; Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There</h3>

<p>There is reliable acoustic phenomenon called "Virtual Pitch": if
the Harmonic Series is processed to remove the Root or Fundamental
tone and then played to a person, that person will hear the note,
<em>including the Root tone, even thought it is not played</em> [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental">miss-fund</a>].
The "Auditory Demonstrations" CD again [<span
class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 20</span>], "Virtual pitch":

<blockquote>

A complex tone consisting of 10 harmonics of 200 Hz having equal
amplitude is presented, first with all harmonics, then without the
fundamental, then without the two lowest harmonics, etc. Low-frequency
noise (300-Hz lowpass, -10dB) is included to mask a 200-Hz difference
tone that might be generated due to distortion in playback equipment.

</blockquote>

<p>As they say, in the demo overtones are subtracted one at a time,
from the fundamental on up. Amazingly, the note being played seems to
stay the same; however it does get more buzzy or annoying to the point
where a fellow listener Simon Goldsmith thought that he would no
longer call the last example the same note [<span
class="cite">Goldsmith, c. 2010</span>].

<p>Virtual pitch is what allows engineers to fake bass notes on small
speakers: they don't play the low tones, as often the speaker is too
physically small to make the fundamental frequency anyway; instead
they play the overtones and rely on your brain to reconstruct the
whole Harmonic Series.  However, as we noted above, you will hear that
small, cheap speakers sound, well, cheap or "tinny"; the bass just
doesn't sound as good as it does when played on sub-woofers. That
said, don't forget how remarkable it is that you can still "hear" the
non-existent fundamental tone at all (which helpfully prevents the
need for people to jog with sub-woofers attached to their ears).  From
[<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental">miss-fund</a>]:

<blockquote>

For example, when a note (that is not a pure tone) has a pitch of 100
Hz, it will consist of frequency components that are integer multiples
of that value (e.g. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500.... Hz). However, smaller
loudspeakers may not produce low frequencies, and so in our example,
the 100 Hz component may be missing. Nevertheless, a pitch
corresponding to the fundamental may still be heard.

</blockquote>

<p>(Note that virtual pitch is a special case of (1) the feature
vector understanding that we give in <a href='#sec_2_5_0'>Section 2.5</a> "Recognition: Feature Vectors" and (2) the concomitant effect of false recognition that we
speak of in <a href='#sec_2_5_2'>Section 2.5.2</a> "False Recognition", where here virtual pitch is
the false recognition of the Harmonic Series.)

<p>(See <a href='#sec_6_2_0'>Section 6.2</a> "Terhardt Does Not Explain Suspended and Minor Chords"
for an illustration by Coren [<span class="cite">Coren1972</span>] (as
quoted by Terhardt [<span class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>]) which
shows standard visual illusions as a metaphor with virtual pitch.)

<p>(In "How to Play From a Fake Book" [<span
class="cite">Neely1999</span>] says that when playing a chord, you can
drop not only the Root of the chord, but also the Fifth and the
listener will <em>still hear the chord</em>; see <a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity". We should point out that here we speak of
omitting one <em>note</em> from a <em>chord</em>, a collection of
<em>multiple notes</em>, or multiple series-es of tones, whereas
virtual pitch is a phenomenon of omitting one <em>tone</em> from a
single Harmonic Series of tones of a <em>single note</em>. However we
argue later in <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes" that these
two situations are closely related and therefore the fact that it
works to omit the Root or Fifth of a chord is actually the phenomenon
of virtual pitch again and is thus more evidence for our theory that
the brain is listening for the Harmonic Series.)

<h3 id=sec_2_1_2>2.1.2&nbsp; Using Greatest Common Divisor as the Missing Fundamental</h3>

<p>What is the means by which the brain determines the missing
fundamental?  From [<span class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo
21</span>], "Shift of Virtual Pitch":

<blockquote>

A tone having strong partials with frequencies of 800, 1000, and 1200
Hz will have a virtual pitch corresponding to the 200 Hz missing
fundamental, as in Demonstration 20.  If each of these partials is
shifted upward by 20 Hz, however, they are no longer exact harmonics
of any fundamental frequency around 200 Hz.  The auditory system will
accept them as being "nearly harmonic" and identify a virtual pitch
slightly above 200 Hz (approximately 1/3 * (820/4 + 1020/5 + 1220/6) =
204 Hz in this case).  The auditory system appears to search for a
"nearly common factor" in the frequencies of the partials.

</blockquote>

<p>There is a simple algorithm for finding the Root of a partial
overtone series:

<blockquote><em>Given a set of tones, hear the (approximate) Greatest
Common Divisor (gcd) of the tones as the fundamental.</em></blockquote>

<p>This conjecture on the brain creating virtual pitch seems to hold
even for non-humans, as pointed out in "This is Your Brain on Music"
by Daniel J. Levitin [<a
href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">Levitin2006, p. 41</a>]
(emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

When I was in graduate school, my advisor, Mike Posner, told me about
the work of a graduate student in biology, Petr Janata....  Peter
[sic] placed electrodes in the inferior colliculus of the barn owl,
part of its auditory system.  Then, he played the owls a version of
Strauss's "The Blue Danube Waltz" made up of tones [by "tones" here he
means what we are calling "notes": each note is an entire series of
overtones] from which the fundamental frequency [what we are calling
the fundamental tone of the overtone series] had been removed.  Petr
hypothesized that if the missing fundamental is restored at the early
levels of auditory processing, neurons in the owl's inferior
colliculus should fire at the rate of the missing fundamental.  This
was exactly what he found.  And because the electrodes put out a small
electrical signal with each firing -- and because the firing
<em>rate</em> is the same as a <em>frequency</em> of firing -- Petr
sent the output of these electrodes to a small amplifier, and played
back the sound of the owl's neurons through a loudspeaker.  What he
heard was astonishing; the melody of "The Blue Danube Waltz" sang
clearly from the loudspeakers: ba da da da da, deet deet, deet deet.
We were <em>hearing</em> the firing rates of the neurons and they were
identical to the frequency of the missing fundamental.  The harmonic
series has an instantiation not just in the early levels of auditory
processing, but in a completely different species.

</blockquote>

<p>Michael O'Donnell pointed out to me that there is an ambiguity here
[<span class="cite">O'Donnell, 14 February 2009</span>]:

<blockquote>

[The above story] doesn't allow one to distinguish whether the Owl, or
the human listener, is experiencing the virtual pitch.

</blockquote>

<p>I passed this on to Daniel J. Levitin; his response [<span
class="cite">Levitin, 24 May 2010</span>]:

<blockquote>

You're absolutely right that these two possibilities need to be
distinguished.  The electrodes that were placed in the brain of the
owl (in the inferior colliculus) were analyzed using
specotrograms[sic] and fourier[sic] analysis.  It was clear that the
signal itself coming from the owl's brain had replaced the missing
fudnamental[sic].  It was only after this analysis that Petr thought
to hook it all up to play the signal over loudspeakers (so that humans
could hear the output) as a cool demonstration.

<p>Female Mosquitoes only mate when rate of the wing-beats of the male
harmonize at a Perfect Fifth above the rate of her wing-beats (we
start introducing musical terminology such as the Perfect Fifth in
<a href='#sec_3_1_0'>Section 3.1</a> "The Major Triad").  From "Mosquitoes make sweet love music"
[<a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7814404.stm">Mosquito-harmony</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>The familiar buzz of a flying female mosquito may be irritating to
humans, but for her male counterpart, it is an irresistible mating
signal.  Males and females each have their own characteristic flight
tone - which they create by beating their wings.

<p>But when scientists from Cornell University listened in on a male
Aedes aegypti pursuing his mate, they were surprised to hear a new
kind of "music" playing....

<p>The amorous couple began to beat their wings together at a matching
frequency - 1,200 hertz.  This love song is a "harmonic", or multiple,
of their individual frequencies - 400 Hz for the female and 600 Hz for
the male....

<p>"So we're trying to discover what makes a male more
attractive. It's a mystery. It could be his odour[sic], or his bright
black and white markings.

<p>"But we think females are assessing the fitness of males based on
how well they can sing."

<h2 id=sec_2_2_0>2.2&nbsp; Artifacts of Optimization</h2>

<p>The brain has constrained resources.  Evolution has no time to
waste and therefore these resources are likely used in an optimal way
-- or at the very least any easy optimizations will have been done for
a given organization of a brain.  (That is, evolution will drive a
machine into a <em>local</em> optimum, even if it gets stuck there and
does not reach a <em>global</em> optimum.)

<p>Having <em>separate</em> hardware in the brain for recognizing
<em>each combination</em> of tones that co-occur in nature is
sub-optimal and it would just be an expensive way to use up
neurons. The algorithm every engineer resorts to in this situation,
and what I suspect the brain does also, is to find a way to "re-use
code": to solve the problem by generalizing the hardware a little so
the same "code" can be used in many more situations.  Here, we want
<em>one</em> Harmonic Series recognizer that works for <em>all</em>
the different overtone series-es we may encounter.

<p>Further, the problem that the brain is solving when listening to
music is <em>recognizing</em> sounds that are important to it, such as
perhaps the nuances of a human voice against a background of noise.  In
order to recognize something, it is ok to simplify the input or throw
away information if it makes the problem easier, as long as enough
information is retained to complete the task.

<p>We now consider two different tricks for greatly simplifying the
computation the brain must do in order to recognize the harmonic
series.  We will also conjecture some computational artifacts of the
way the brain computes that should result from these optimizations,
resulting in well-known universal features of music: relative pitch
and octaves.

<h3 id=sec_2_2_1>2.2.1&nbsp; Relative Pitch: Differences Between Sounds</h3>

<p>Again, most engineers would tell you that, given the problem of
designing a brain to recognize the Harmonic Series, their intuition
would tell them to build <em>one</em>, <em>single</em> Harmonic Series
recognizer, not a different one for every possible note. The way to
accomplish this would be to make the machine recognize only that which
is the same (or mostly the same) in all overtone series-es and ignore
that which changes.  While the tones of different Harmonic Series-es
differ, conveniently the <em>ratio</em> of their frequencies to their
fundamental frequency does not. Therefore we consider it very likely
that

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Four</strong>: The brain normalizes
tones by dividing tones to get tone ratios.</blockquote>

<p>Recognizing <em>ratios</em> of tones (and notes) more strongly than
the absolute tones themselves is a phenomenon called "Relative Pitch"
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_pitch">rel</a>]. A ratio
of a pair of tones (or notes) is called an "interval".

<h3 id=sec_2_2_2>2.2.2&nbsp; Octaves: Sounds Normalized to a Factor of Two</h3>

<p>Processing sound requires operating on frequencies over several
orders of magnitude.  If these frequencies could be made to
"wrap-around" then we have another opportunity for code re-use.

<p>When the police take a mug shot of a criminal, their goal is to
take the photo in such a way as to maximize the recognizability of the
subject in the future given the photo.  They employ a common trick
used in the recognition problem: they photograph the subject in
standard positions (front and profile), under standard lighting
conditions, against a standard backdrop, and after removing any
obscuring clothing.  We say they <em>normalize</em> the photograph:
they remove information irrelevant to the thing to be recognized and
put it in a standard form; doing this helps <em>recognize</em> the
thing later.

<p>Consider the conceptually straightforward process of the brain
halving or doubling the frequency of a wave until it is within a
particular range.  Now the brain only needs a Harmonic Series
recognizer for tones within a frequency range of a <em>single</em>
factor of two, not across the whole spectrum of sound.  Breaking the
problem into two parts like this, (1) normalization followed by (2)
recognition, greatly simplifies the resulting frequency recognizer. We
therefore consider it likely that

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Five</strong>: The brain normalizes
tones by halving or doubling them until within a particular frequency
range spanned by a factor of two. </blockquote>

<p>The individual computational units of the brain are not as fast as
those in modern electronics, however those of the brain are operating
in "massive parallel": many operations may be computed at once and all
that is needed is that one find the answer.  To the intuition of
anyone who has seen hardware designed it seems very likely that the
brain is halving/doubling frequencies by many different powers of two
in parallel and then running all of the results through the frequency
recognizer at once.  If any one matches, the harmonic has been found.

<p>If this were so, then tones (and notes) that differ from each other
by a factor of two would sound very much alike. The range of notes
that are all within one factor of two is called in music an "Octave"
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave">oct</a>]. ("Oct" is Latin
for eight, not two; the relationship to the number eight will become
clear later.) Levitin again from "This is Your Brain on Music" [<a
href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">Levitin2006, p. 29</a>]:

<blockquote>

Here is a fundamental quality of music.  Note names repeat because of
a perceptual phenomenon that corresponds to the doubling and halving
of frequencies.  When we double or halve a frequency, we end up with a
note that sounds remarkably similar to the one we started out with.
This relationship, a frequency ratio of 2:1 or 1:2, is called the
octave.  It is so important that, in spite of the large differences
that exist between musical cultures -- between Indian, Balinese,
European, Middle Eastern, Chinese, and so on -- every culture we know
of has the octave as the basis for its music, even if it has little
else in common with other musical traditions.

</blockquote>

<p>Again, according to Levitin, the Octave interval occurs in every
musical tradition in the world.  This observation is the first of many
to suggest that the musicality of sound depends on something universal
about human beings, rather than simply being learned from culture.

<h2 id=sec_2_3_0>2.3&nbsp; Harmony: Sweetness is the Ideal</h2>

<p>Recall from <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series" that the brain uses differences from the
ideal/cartoon model as a kind of or "personality" or in this case
"timbre".  Recall from the same section that Levitin suggests that we
use this timbre to solve the important problem of recognizing people
and their emotional state.  But being perfect makes this recognition
hard; from "What Caricatures Can Teach Us About Facial Recognition"
[<a
href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_caricature/">Austen-caricature</a>]
(see <a href='#sec_2_5_2'>Section 2.5.2</a> "False Recognition" for more):

<blockquote>

<p>[W]hen you talk to these artists about their process, you realize
that the psychologists have gotten the basics down pretty well. When
Court Jones, the 2005 Golden Nosey winner, describes how he teaches
the craft to younger artists, he lays out exactly the algorithm that
vision scientists believe humans use to identify faces. Students, he
says, should imagine a generic face and then notice how the subject
deviates from it: "That's what you can judge all other faces off of."

<p>Also, just as a vision scientist would predict, symmetrical faces
-- those close to our internal average -- are especially difficult to
caricature. People at the convention mention struggles with Katy Perry
and Brad Pitt; the animator Bill Plympton, a guest speaker at the
convention, tells me that Michael Caine has long been a bête
noire. The same principle explains why the person at the convention
with maybe the least symmetrical of faces appears by week's end in no
fewer than 33 works of art on the ballroom walls.

</blockquote>

<p>I don't think I need a citation to claim that Katy Perry and Brad
Pitt are considered to be very beautiful people.  This suggests
another conjecture.

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Six</strong>: Absence of distortion (or
personality or timbre) is sweetness.</blockquote>

<h3 id=sec_2_3_1>2.3.1&nbsp; Recreating an Ideal Harmonic Series using Instruments having Systematically-Distorted Timbre</h3>

<p>In <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series" above we saw that the overtone series of a <em>single</em>
instrument is easily distorted by myriad physical effects.  However,
recall that for the same (kind of) instrument, those distortions were
systematic and reliable.  Therefore by playing <ul>

  <li>multiple notes,

  <li>on instruments having the same (or similar) timbre,

  <li>and relying on Relative Pitch to subtract the differences for us,

</ul>

<p>from <em>distorted</em> overtone series-es we can magically
recreate parts of the <em>ideal</em> Harmonic Series!

<h3 id=sec_2_3_2>2.3.2&nbsp; Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes</h3>

<p>Suppose we play two notes on the piano that are a Fifth (a factor
of 3/2) apart.  Per O'Donnell's comment in <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series" above, since piano strings
are not the strings of ideal physics, they don't make an ideal
Harmonic Series.  Instead, each tone in the series is moved by being
multiplied by some fudge factor.  However notice that strings on the
piano are made of the same stuff, at least nearby strings, and this
fudge factor should therefore be somewhat consistent <em>across</em>
strings.  That is, two corresponding tones at the same point in the
overtone series of two <em>different</em> notes should get multiplied
by the <em>same</em> fudge.

<pre>
   Tones of 1st note:  1  ---> (1   * 2 * fudge2) ---> (1   * 3 * fudge3) ...
                       -        ----------------        ----------------
                       |                |                       |
                       |                |                       |
                       v                v                       v
                      ---       ----------------        ----------------
   Tones of 2nd note: 3/2 ---> (3/2 * 2 * fudge2) ---> (3/2 * 3 * fudge3) ...
</pre>

<p>Now notice that there are <em>two kinds</em> of intervals of tone
pairs:<ul>

  <li>"horizontal": intervals made by pairs of tones within the
  one series of tones generated by one note, and

  <li>"vertical": intervals made by pairs of tones across the two
  series-es of tones generated by the two different notes, especially
  those of corresponding overtones.

</ul>

<h3 id=sec_2_3_3>2.3.3&nbsp; Vertical Intervals Have Pure Ratios</h3>

<p>As O'Donnell points out above in <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series", real instruments can
systematically produce overtones at frequencies different from those
of the ideal Harmonic Series; one such instrument is the piano which
produces stretched overtones. However, these distortions from the
ideal Harmonic Series affect these horizontal and vertical intervals
differently:<ul>

  <li><strong>Horizontal intervals are fudged</strong>: the ratio of
  overtone 3 of the 2nd note to overtone 1 of the 2nd note has fudge
  in it:

</ul>

<pre>
    (3/2 * 3 * fudge3) / (3/2)        = 3 * <strong>fudge3</strong>,
</pre>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Vertical intervals are pure</strong>: the ratio of
  overtone 3 of the 2nd note to overtone 3 of the 1st note is pure:

</ul>

<pre>
    (3/2 * 3 * fudge3) / (3 * fudge3) = 3/2 <strong>(pure!)</strong>.
</pre>

<p>However, I would be remiss if I did not point out here [<span
class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 31</span>], "Tones and Tuning with
Stretched Partials" from "Auditory Demonstrations" CD, quoted in
<a href='#sec_5_1_0'>Section 5.1</a> "Helmholtz's Theory Relies Only On Interfering Overtones, But Harmony Is Something More".  In Demo 31, a piece by Bach is played on
computer-generated piano (part 1) having normal overtones and (part 4)
having overtones where an Octave is stretched from a factor of 2 to a
factor of 2.1.  Taken naively, our theory that the purity of vertical
intervals matters to the brain suggests that these should both
harmonize; however the normal one (part 1) certainly sounds better.
We suggest therefore that if the horizontal intervals are distorted
grossly enough, then the fact that the vertical intervals are pure
cannot save the harmony from being destroyed by the dissonance of the
horizontal intervals.

<h3 id=sec_2_3_4>2.3.4&nbsp; Vertical Intervals Have Balanced Amplitudes</h3>

<p>As Levitin points out above in <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series", real instruments can
systematically produce overtones at amplitudes different from those of
the ideal Harmonic Series; one such instrument is the clarinet which
emphasizes the odd overtones. Again however, these distortions of the
ideal Harmonic Series affect these horizontal and vertical intervals
differently:<ul>

  <li><strong>Horizontal intervals are sometimes made by a pair of
  tones having unbalanced amplitudes</strong>: for example, with the
  clarinet the ratio of an odd overtone to an even overtone will be an
  interval between a loud tone and a soft tone.

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Vertical intervals are always made by a pair of tones
  having balanced amplitudes</strong>: again, the amplitude variations
  are systematic, so the tones that are paired up vertically will have
  the same amplitude variations.

</ul>

<h3 id=sec_2_3_5>2.3.5&nbsp; Vertical Intervals Are All The Same Ratio</h3>

<p>Further, these two kinds of intervals are going to show up very
differently to the relative pitch detector:

<ul>

  <li><strong>Horizontal intervals are only one of each kind, a
  Whitman's Sampler</strong>: while there is sweetness in one voice,
  especially that of a trained singer, as in the horizontal intervals
  of that voice there is <em>one</em> instance of <em>each</em>
  interval of the Harmonic Series (albeit with the fudge we mentioned
  above of horizontal intervals).

  <li><strong>Vertical intervals are all of the same kind, an entire
  box of chocolate almond cherry</strong>: on the other hand when two
  voices are sung, say, a Fifth apart, there is an entire
  <em>wall</em> of the same <em>kind</em> of sweetness, a wall of
  <em>many</em> Fifths coming at you, namely the vertical intervals
  above, <em>each</em> of which is a Fifth.

</ul>

<p>(Again, for an introduction to musical intervals such as the
Fifth), see <a href='#sec_3_1_0'>Section 3.1</a> "The Major Triad".)

<h3 id=sec_2_3_6>2.3.6&nbsp; Harmony is Sweeter Than Sweet</h3>

<blockquote><em>Therefore we see that note ratios induce a set of the
same tone ratios.  Further these tone ratios are pure, have balanced
amplitudes, and are all of the same interval.</em></blockquote>

<p>This harmonic effect works best if the two notes of an interval are
played on the same instrument having therefore the <em>same</em>
distortions from the ideal Harmonic Series. My Men's Chorale teacher
Bill Ganz told us that to have our voices harmonize, we should sing
the same vowels, which supports this theory as the same vowels will
have closer timbres [<span class="cite">Ganz, c. fall 1991</span>]
(Bill says this is a known effect, not something he independently
observed; a cursory search does not produce a better reference, so I
cite him). Notice that this effect allows instruments making tones
that are not anywhere near the Harmonic Series to still harmonize with
each other (at least up to a point where the horizontal intervals
interfere too much; see the point about [<span
class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 31</span>] in <a href='#sec_2_3_3'>Section 2.3.3</a> "Vertical Intervals Have Pure Ratios").

<p>The wall of vertical intervals hammer the same relative pitch
sensor with a wall of the pure interval one of the features of the
cartoon physics ideal Harmonize Series of your brain is looking for.
Recall from the introduction to <a href='#sec_2_0_0'>Section 2</a> "Living in a Computational Cartoon" the effect of pantyhose making a leg look rounder than round;
again more on this effect in <a href='#sec_2_5_0'>Section 2.5</a> "Recognition: Feature Vectors".
Harmony is sweeter than sweet. It's impossibly sweet -- impossible for
one voice anyway -- which is just what the theory predicts.

<h2 id=sec_2_4_0>2.4&nbsp; Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity</h2>

<p>Anticipation and prediction is one of the fundamental operations of
the brain.  We suggest that there is an art to balancing the
simplicity and complexity: if understanding and predicting a storyline
are too easy, then it is boring, and if too hard, then it is noise,
but if just right, then it is interesting.  As we discuss below, (1)
simplicity comes from data having a "theme" and (2), ambiguity is the
absence of a single explanation or theme and therefore a good way to
rapidly produce complexity.  See <a href='#sec_7_2_0'>Section 7.2</a> "The Role of Narrative Generally" for how theme and ambiguity are unified to make narrative.

<h3 id=sec_2_4_1>2.4.1&nbsp; The Simplicity of Theme</h3>

<p>People frequently experience that, before receiving information,
having an expectation as to the context of that information, <em>its
theme</em>, helps considerably in the processing of it.  For example,
people who speak more than one language sometimes have the experience
of hearing words (1) in a language that they know, but (2) that they
were not expecting, and therefore not understanding those words until
they "listen" to them again in their mind from within the context of
the language in which those words were spoken.  There are myriad
examples of context influencing how something occurs to someone.

<p><strong>Surprise Reduction</strong>: The technical name for the
amount of expected information one gets from situation is the
<em>entropy</em> [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">ent</a>] [<a
href="http://danielwilkerson.com/entropy.html">Wilkerson-entropy</a>].
Some call the entropy of a measurement the amount of <em>surprise</em>
one expects get out of it. Clearly, if one knows more about what to
expect in a situation, the amount of surprise can be greatly reduced.
Since it is work to process information, we suggest that the brain
likes to have reliable expectations in order to minimize the amount of
surprise it is dealing with all day.

<p><strong>Model Inference</strong>: Life is full of situations where
we may observe the consequences of a situation but are not told
explicitly what is the state of the situation.  There is nothing left
to do but to <em>infer</em> a model of the state of affairs from
observation of many details, and therefore inference is likely a
constant activity of the brain.  For example, people often infer the
rules of a game from observation and without reading the rules.

<p>Have you ever seen someone color-coordinate their clothes or even
their room?  Have you ever been to a "theme party" where everyone was
to dress and act from a given era or situation?  How about a "theme
restaurant" or "theme park"?  Having a <em>theme</em> for all of the
elements of a given situation <ul>

  <li>(surprise reduction) reduces the amount of new
  information or "surprise" that each one introduces, and

  <li>(ease of inference) allows the brain to construct a whole from
  the parts.

</ul>Differences and changes are interesting to the brain, but too
much difference fails to feel "unified" -- it does not all occur as
parts of a whole.  In support of both surprise-reduction and ease of
inference, we consider it likely that

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Seven</strong>: The brain wants input
to have a <em>theme</em>.  That is, the brain both infers themes from
input and uses themes as context when processing input.</blockquote>

<h3 id=sec_2_4_2>2.4.2&nbsp; The Complexity of Ambiguity</h3>

Research on parsing of sentences suggests that one of the major
functions of the brain is to disambiguate ambiguous and incomplete
input.  In "From Molecule to Metaphor", Jerome Feldman, both a
Computer and Cognitive Scientist, points out how much of the brain's
processing of sentences is devoted to disambiguation and how easy it
is to tease the brain by using ambiguous inputs that resolve in an
unusual way.  From [<span class="cite">Feldman2006, p. 307,
308</span>] (unconventional spacing in the original):

<blockquote>

Please read the following sentence aloud slowly, word by word:<br>

<blockquote>The &nbsp;&nbsp; horse &nbsp;&nbsp; raced &nbsp;&nbsp;
past &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; barn &nbsp;&nbsp; fell.
</blockquote>

Sentences like these are called garden-path sentences because, in slow
reading, we often notice that we have followed an analysis path that
turned out to be wrong....

<p>But why are people surprised in garden-path situations?  The brain
is a massively parallel information processor and is able to retain
multiple active possibilities for interpreting sentence, scene, and so
on.  Well, there must be a cutoff after which some possible
interpretations are deemed so unlikely as to be not worth keeping
active.  The final piece of their [referring to a model given by other
researchers] model was an assumption that a hypothesis was abandoned
if its belief net score was less than 20% of that of its rival.  We
experience surprise when the analysis needed for a full sentence is
one that was deactivated earlier as unlikely.  This is a complex
computational model, but nothing simpler can capture all the necessary
interactions.

</blockquote>

<p>The input the brain gets as we live life is inherently and often
wildly ambiguous.  Alternatives multiply and so the number possible
ambiguities in a situation can easily grow exponentially.  No machine
can keep up with the demands of a problem the size of which grows that
fast.  Therefore:

<blockquote><em>Much of the brain is a massive disambiguation engine
that is running all the time and is functioning at its computational
limit.</em></blockquote>

<p>Jokes are often of the form of an ambiguity of contexts/themes
resolved by a punchline which evaluates one way in one context and
another way in the other context (say true in one and false in the
other); the story that precedes the punchline serves to amplify the
weaker context, the weaker side of the ambiguity, so as to maximize
the punch of the line by making it break symmetry between two almost
equal contexts/themes.  Story plots are often of this form as well, in
particular mysteries.  The language of Shakespeare is full of double
meanings and even perhaps a triple meaning here and there.  These are
all to the same purpose:

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Eight</strong>: The brain enjoys having
its disambiguation engine teased.</blockquote>

<h2 id=sec_2_5_0>2.5&nbsp; Recognition: Feature Vectors</h2>

<p>I need to introduce yet another computational idiom: the feature
vector [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector">feat</a>].
It is actually a completely straightforward idea that you already use
every day.  Think of how you summarize a thing when you post an online
ad to sell it.  Suppose you are selling a car.  You might very well
put in the ad the total volume of the cylinders in the engine.  Your
probably won't list the number of bolts in the engine.  You probably
will list how many miles the engine has driven.  You probably will not
list the number of hours the radio has been on (even if you knew it).
The point is that

<blockquote> <em>Humans naturally <span class="emph">abstract</span>;
that is, they retain the <span class="emph">features</span> that are
important for a given <span class="emph">purpose</span> and discard
the rest.  </em></blockquote>

<p>All language is abstraction.  Suppose I point at a chair and I say
"what is that?"  You say "that is a chair."  I say "are you telling
the <em>complete</em> truth?"  You say "yes!"  I lean down and look
very closely and I say "yea, but you didn't mention this little
scratch down here...."  You roll your eyes in annoyance.

<p>An abstraction is a reduced amount of information that still serves
the purpose. In the context of recognizing a thing as a member of a
class, an abstract adjective is called a "feature". Usually there is
more than one, so we collect them together into a "vector", which just
means a list where the elements are not interchangeable (that is, you
can't swap the mileage and the year of a car without severely changing
the meaning of the car ad).

<p>Once we have described a class of inputs as a vector of features,
we have a clear algorithm for recognizing a thing as being a member of
that class: <ol>

  <li>Whenever we encounter a thing, for each feature (in parallel),
      check if that feature is present.

  <li>If all (or most) of the features in the vector are present
      ("fire"), then recognize the thing as being in the class
      abstracted by the feature ("fire" the whole recognizer).

</ol>

<p>Note that the second part above which looks for the conjunction of
features may be realized by a more sophisticated mechanism than a
simple AND gate that just fires its output when all of its inputs have
fired: a simple conjunction mechanism would be too "brittle" in the
face of the noisy input of the real world.  For example, even plants
such as the Venus Fly Trap can compute a rather sophisticated
conjunction of features before recognizing a fly [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Flytrap">venus-fly</a>]:

<blockquote>

The trapping mechanism is so specialized that it can distinguish
between living prey and non-prey stimuli such as falling raindrops;
two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of
each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon
the lobes of the trap will snap shut in about 0.1 seconds.

</blockquote>

<p>Recall that in the case of virtual pitch, the feature recognition
mechanism seems to find the greatest common divisor of the tones
presented; that is, this recognizer uses a special wholistic property
of this particular set of features in order to work well in the face
of missing features.  Recall that a timbre amounts to the systematic
absence of parts of the idea Harmonic Series and that real sounds (in
particular, voices) exhibit a range of timbres; thus the Harmonic
Series recognizer must be able to robustly find the fundamental even
when some of the tones are missing.  See <a href='#sec_2_1_1'>Section 2.1.1</a> "Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There", <a href='#sec_2_1_2'>Section 2.1.2</a> "Using Greatest Common Divisor as the Missing Fundamental", and <a href='#sec_1_5_1'>Section 1.5.1</a> "Timbre: Systematic Distortions from the Ideal Harmonic Series".

<h3 id=sec_2_5_1>2.5.1&nbsp; Soft Computing</h3>

<p>Machines are good at crisp, mechanical behavior, such as adding
huge lists of numbers.  This is fun for a while, but it can get old.

<blockquote><em>I don't often need huge lists of numbers added, but I
really would like to go to an online auction site and find a car that
is "sort of" like my ideal car which I might be willing to
describe.</em></blockquote>

<p>You will notice the use of the non-crisp or "soft" phrase "sort of"
in the previous problem specification.  Some people try to get
machines to do this sort of soft reasoning that humans do so well.  It
can sometimes be done, at least within a very constrained context of,
say, shopping for cars or plane tickets.  Such a discipline is called
Artificial Intelligence or Soft Computing or Machine Learning or
Statistical Inference, depending on exactly how one goes about it and
who is providing the research funding.  The important thing for us is
that describing problems using feature vectors is a very general and
widely used technique.  Recalling our conjecture that computational
laws are universal, we would not find it surprising if

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Nine</strong>: The brain uses feature
vectors for recognition.</blockquote>

<h3 id=sec_2_5_2>2.5.2&nbsp; False Recognition</h3>

<p>To get the brain to (1) have the experience of the presence of a
thing, it is not necessary to (2) present the actual thing to the
brain.  It is enough to just present <em>anything</em> that fires the
feature vector in the brain assigned to recognize that thing.  That
is, if I want you to think "hamburger" I don't have to show you a
hamburger, only a picture of one.  Recall the example from <a href='#sec_2_0_0'>Section 2</a> "Living in a Computational Cartoon" of pantyhose making a leg look
rounder than round, impossibly round.

<p>It is pretty easy to tell the difference between a photograph of
something and the thing itself: you wouldn't accidentally eat a
photograph of a hamburger.  Yet at the same time the picture
definitely says "hamburger" to your brain, often strongly enough that
you are willing to part with some money to have a real one right now!
But it gets even weirder.

<blockquote><em>Have you ever seen a cartoon of a person that looks
more like the person than the person does?</em></blockquote>

<p>Some political cartoonists are very good.  They <ol>

  <li>pick some very unusual <em>features</em> of the person, and then

  <li><em>exaggerate</em> those features.

</ol>

<p>Amazingly, what can result is something that looks more like the
person than the person.  From [<a
href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/06/04/why-so-many-artists-have-lazy-eyes-and-other-things-art-can-teach-us-about-the-brain/">Harmon-art-brain</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>As someone who has worked in pen and ink for decades, cartoonist
Jules Feiffer realizes that "what we see is often quite divorced from
what is actually there," he noted. He calls the two-dimensional
representations metaphors, noting that "the metaphor is often more
understandable than the real thing."

<p>And research on the perception of faces reveals that the human
brain and individual neurons are tuned to extreme representations,
explained Margaret Livingstone, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard
Medical School. Her research has shown that people are much quicker to
recognize caricatures of people than documentary photographs, showing
how the brain at work prizes the representative over the more factual.

</blockquote>

<p>From "What Caricatures Can Teach Us About Facial Recognition" [<a
href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_caricature/">Austen-caricature</a>]
:

<blockquote>

<p>At the University of Central Lancashire in England, Charlie Frowd,
a senior lecturer in psychology, has used insights from caricature to
develop a better police-composite generator. His system, called
EvoFIT, produces animated caricatures, with each successive frame
showing facial features that are more exaggerated than the last.
Frowd's research supports the idea that we all store memories as
caricatures, but with our own personal degree of amplification. So as
an animated composite depicts faces at varying stages of caricature,
viewers respond to the stage that is most recognizable to them. In
tests, Frowd's technique has increased identification rates from as
low as 3 percent to upwards of 30 percent.

<p>. . . "A lot of people think that caricature is about picking out
someone's worst feature and exaggerating it as far as you can," Seiler
says. "That's wrong. Caricature is basically finding the truth. And
then you push the truth."

</blockquote>

<p>The features can be anything that is important to the task of
recognizing that person: a nose or lip shape, etc. -- technically,
this feature has a lot of "information".  An good example of this I
remember was a yellow smiley face that had red blotch on its forehead
-- everyone knew it was Mikhail Gorbachev [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">gorb</a>].

<blockquote><em>While a thing may induce a feature vector in the brain
for use later in recognize the thing, some other things will also fire
that vector, causing artificial recognition.</em></blockquote>

<h3 id=sec_2_5_3>2.5.3&nbsp; Cubism: Partial Recognition Due to Redundant, Over-Determined Feature Vectors</h3>

<img style="float:right" src=picasso_head_of_a_woman-1938.png
alt='["Head of a Woman" by Pablo Picasso [Picasso1938]]' />

<p>There is no rule that says that the features in a feature vector
must be <em>independent</em>, that for every subset of features, there
is some input that will fire those features and not the others.  If
the brain is doing all it can to recognize things as fast and cheaply
as possible, it is going to use the most effective features it has and
some redundant / over-determined sets of features can easily arise.

<p>Hmm, what would you experience if <em>some</em> but not
<em>all</em> of the features in a vector were to fire?  Note that,
while there may be no <em>natural</em> input that can cause this, that
does not mean that there is no such <em>art-</em>ificial input.  This
leads to interesting phenomena that can be exploited by artists.

<p>Cubism is a form of art from the early 20th century that has a
certain particular quality:

<ul>

  <li>the <em>parts</em> of an object may be rendered reasonably
faithfully so that one recognizes them,

  <li>however they do not arrange into a <em>whole</em> in a coherent
  way.

</ul>

<p>This produces an interesting effect:

<ul>

<li>we recognize the object, as the features we require for
recognition do fire,

<li>although we still have an overall feeling that we are not seeing
the thing in it's natural form, but instead in a disturbed or unhappy
or dreamy state.

</ul>

<p>You may say "Of course it looks disturbed!  It's all messed up!"
But think for a moment: if it is all messed up, how is it that it
<em>looks like anything at all?</em> Again, per <a href='#sec_2_5_2'>Section 2.5.2</a> "False Recognition", because the features are present.

<p>Consider Picasso's "Head of a Woman" [<span
class="cite">Picasso1938</span>] on the right.  One eye is in profile
and the other is straight ahead, a physical impossibility.  Yet we
have no trouble at all instantly recognizing a woman.

<h1 id=sec_3_0_0>3&nbsp; Harmonic Music Explained</h1>

<p>What can we make of all of this?  Do the above insights into
physics and computation yet provide enough information for us to
derive something that we recognize as music?  For example, can we
compute a set of notes that will sound good when played together?

<p>Recall the observation of <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes"
that two <em>notes</em> induce parallel vertical series-es of
<em>overtones</em> all of the same ratio means that <em>note</em>
ratio and <em>tone</em> ratio are intimately connected.  That is, from
now on, when speaking of two <em>notes</em> that are in a ratio, what
we really mean is that the overtone series-es of the two notes make
two series-es of vertical <em>tones</em> having that ratio.  From now
on we will omit reiterating this point and simply speak of "the ratio
of two notes making an interval within the Harmonic Series".

<h2 id=sec_3_1_0>3.1&nbsp; The Major Triad</h2>

<p>Let's try the simplest thing we can that will generate notes that
the brain wants to hear together (recall from <a href='#sec_2_1_0'>Section 2.1</a> "Searching for Harmonics" how much the brain wants to hear the Harmonic Series):<ul>

  <li>find the ideal Harmonic Series induced by, say, Middle C,

  <li>map it into one Octave by dividing by two whenever necessary,

  <li>replace <em>tones</em> with <em>notes</em> as, again, these
  notes will induce the same (vertical) intervals as the tones.

</ul>

<p>Note that in Scientific Pitch Notation [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation">sci-pitch</a>]
the particular Octave that contains Middle C is "Octave 4", the next
Octave up is "Octave 5", etc., where we increment the octave number
each time we cross the note C.  Starting at C4 the sequence of notes
we get is as follows.

<ul>

<li>Factor of 1: The fundamental: C4.

<li>Factor of 2: This is just C5 (up one Octave); dividing by 2 gives
us 1 times C4 = C4 again, so no new note in the collection.

<li>Factor of 3: This is G5; divide once by 2 gives us 3/2 times C4 =
G4.  This is the first really "interesting" different note.

<li>Factor of 4: This is C6; dividing twice by 2 gives us 1 times C4 =
C4 again, which we have already in our collection.

<li>Factor of 5: This is close to E4; dividing twice by 2 gives us 5/4
times C4 = E4.  Ah, another new and "interesting" note.

<li>Factor of 6: This is G6; dividing twice by 2 gives us 6/4 times C4
= 3/2 times C4 = G4, which we already have in our collection.

</ul>

<p>Let's stop here. (We stop at harmonic 6 in particular for a reason
that will become clear later.) The starting tone/note of Middle C is
arbitrary, but the ratios we we get, namely 1, 5/4, and 3/2, times the
fundamental, are not. Three notes in these ratios are called "The
Major Triad". There are standard names for these notes (relative to
the fundamental): reordering them from the harmonic order above to
their numeric order when folded down into one Octave, the first note
(1) is called the "Root", the second (harmonic 5, so in this Octave
5/4) is called the "Major Third", and the third (harmonic 3, so in
this Octave 3/2) is called the "Perfect Fifth" (!).  The weirdness of
musical nomenclature is just beginning.  Note further that it is
unclear which terms should be capitalized; we treat as proper nouns
any illusory Platonic ideal objects created by the mind: "Harmonic
Series", "Major Triad", etc.  Again, these names of the intervals
reflect their position in the Major Scale, described below, and as you
can see, confusingly do not correspond to their order in the Harmonic
Series.

<pre>
    Major Triad
    Root:         (harmonic 1):   1 = 1.0.
    Major Third   (harmonic 5): 5/4 = 1.25.
    Perfect Fifth (harmonic 3): 3/2 = 1.5.
</pre>

<p>Note that according to our measure of interestingness in <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity", the intervals of the Fifth
(factor of 3) and the Third (factor of 5) are, in that order, the most
interesting intervals: (1) they are in the theme of the Harmonic
Series, while also (2) they have some complexity resulting from not
being a simple power of two times the Root (which if they were would
make them subject to the octave effect tending to make two notes sound
like one; that is, a factor of 2 is too boring).

<p>If we pick C as the Root (as we did above) then the resulting Major
Triad is called the "chord" of C Major.  The starting node of "C" was
arbitrary; however the resulting triad was not.  Is it so surprising
that this Major Triad is everywhere in music?  It sounds rather nice
to play notes in the C-Major Triad; try it.  However, after a while it
is a little boring, so we would like to add some variety.  How little
complexity can we add and yet still change something?

<h2 id=sec_3_2_0>3.2&nbsp; The Major Scale</h2>

<p>The Major Scale [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale">maj</a>] is so
fundamental to Western music that it is even "built into" the notation
(the Major Scale is sometimes called the Diatonic Scale, although the
term "Diatonic" seems to mean different things depending on who you
ask, therefore instead I use the less ambiguous term "Major"): if you
play notes by going up the white keys of a piano keyboard one step at
a time, which is the same as going up the alternating lines and spaces
of an unadorned musical score, you are playing the C Major Scale.  Is
this Major Scale arbitrary or is it somehow fundamental to the way the
brain hears? If it is fundamental, we should be able derive such a
thing simply from first principles as we suggested in the
introduction. Let's try it.

<h3 id=sec_3_2_1>3.2.1&nbsp; Interlocking Triads</h3>

<p>Well, we like the Major Triad, so let's make another one, but
starting with a different note as the fundamental.  To preserve as
much theme with the previous triad, let's start with the "closest"
notes to the C that we have in our first triad: The first note other
than C that we hit was 3/2 times the Root, also called the Perfect
Fifth; therefore let's build a triad using 3/2 times C4 = G4 as the
fundamental.  Let's remember to divide by 2 when necessary to keep
everything within the same Octave.

<pre>
    Major Triad Up by a Perfect Fifth
    Root:          3/2 *   1 =  3/2 = 1.5.
    Major Third:   3/2 * 5/4 = 15/8 = 1.875.
    Perfect Fifth: 3/2 * 3/2 =  9/4,
      which is bigger than 2,
      so divide by 2, giving:   9/8 = 1.125.
</pre>

<p>Ok, that was so much fun let's go in the other direction as well.
That is, let's make yet another Major Triad where that the Perfect
Fifth of <em>that</em> Triad is the Root of our <em>first</em> Triad.
That means multiplying by 1/(3/2) = 2/3; therefore let's build a triad
using 2/3 times C4 = F3 as the fundamental.  Let's be sure to multiply
by 2 when necessary to keep everything within the same Octave.  (Note
that throughout we use "~" (tilde) to mean "almost equals".)

<pre>
    Major Triad Down by a Perfect Fifth
    Root:          2/3 *   1 = 2/3
      which is smaller than 1,
      so mult by 2: 4/3             ~ 1.333.
    Major Third:   2/3 * 5/4 = 5/6
      which is smaller than 1,
      so mult by 2: 5/3             ~ 1.666.
    Perfect Fifth: 2/3 * 3/2 = 1    = 1.0.
</pre>

<p>Note that the selection of three interlocking triads is suggested
by our measure of interestingness from <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity".  That is, using three overlapping Major Triads (1)
maximizes the theme of the Harmonic Series while not requiring any
harmonics beyond harmonic 5 (the interval called the Third), while
also (2) having some complexity by not all being of one Harmonic
Series.

<p>Now we have three "interlocking" Triads: the Perfect Fifth of one
is the Root of the next.  How many notes is that?  Three notes per
triad times three triads is nine notes; however two of the notes where
the triads interlock are counted twice, so there are 3 * 3 - 2 = 7
unique notes.  Let's plot them on a line to see how far they are from
one another.

<h3 id=sec_3_2_2>3.2.2&nbsp; Using Logarithms to Visualize Distances Between Tones/Notes</h3>

<p>Wait... before we do that, when plotting notes, such a plot should
"mean something to us".  As we saw above, what makes sense would be
for the <em>ratios</em> of the notes to have some regularity; that is
the <em>multiplicative</em> ratios of frequencies is what our brain is
listening to, <em>not</em> the <em>additive</em> distances.  For this
plot to mean something, we would want equal <em>ratios</em> to show up
equally on the plot.  How do we turn (multiplicative) ratios into
(additive) distances?

<p>The function that does this is called the "logarithm" (or just
"log") [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log</a>].
Explaining it is beyond the scope of this article, but basically if
you count someone's income by how many digits they have in it, you are
already familiar with logarithms.  In general, a "six-figure income"
is ten times that of a "five-figure income" (though a high five-figure
income is usually pretty close to a low six-figure income, so the
example isn't perfect).  That is, by counting the number of figures,
you have turned a (multiplicative) ratio of a <em>factor</em> of
<em>one</em> ten into an (additive) <em>increment</em> of <em>one</em>
figure of income.  You see,

<blockquote><em>After going through the logarithm, <span
class="emph">multiplicative factors</span> turn into <span
class="emph">additive increments</span>.</em></blockquote>

<p>The logarithm we want turns factors into increments in the same way
as the income example, except that we care about factors of 2 instead
of 10, so we take logs "base 2" (instead of "base 10"): each
multiplicative factor of 2 will be displayed as one unit of additive
increment in the graph called an Octave.  This means that the relative
pitch of specific tone (or note) <em>ratios</em> shows up as specific
<em>distances</em> between tone (or note) logarithms.

<p><em>You can skip the next little section if your eyes are glazing
over.  All you need to remember is that on a logarithmic scale a
multiplicative factor looks like an additive increment.</em>

<h4>Some Technical Details on Logarithms and Exponents</h4>

<blockquote><strong><em>*** Feel free to skip this section!
***</em></strong></blockquote>

<p>The "log base 2 of x" is usually denoted something like "log_2(x)";
to avoid visual clutter, we omit the parentheses around "x" when the
meaning is unambiguous, writing "log_2 x".  When computing the ratio
of two logs, as we do in <a href='#sec_3_5_3'>Section 3.5.3</a> "Chords from the Harmonic Series",
the bases of the logs don't matter (they cancel out) and so we omit
them, writing simply "log x / log y".

<p>We denote the exponential, raising a base, b, to a power, y, as
"b^<sup>y</sup>".  (Note that your browser may or may not render the y
as a superscript; in case it does not, I have also redundantly
retained the "^" character.)  The logarithm and exponential are
inverses, so

<pre>
    b^<sup>(log_b x)</sup> = x and
    log_b(b^<sup>y</sup>) = y
</pre>

<p>You can use exponentials to think about logarithms.  When computing
the ratios of numbers, imagine each number represented as an
exponential of a base, such as 2.  Now think about what multiplication
and division of that number do to the exponent as the numbers are
divided or multiplied.  That is, if we think of taking the
<em>ratio</em> of two numbers represented as exponents we see that we
we are just <em>subtracting</em> their exponents (the logarithms of
the original numbers); that is,

<pre>
    2^<sup>p</sup> / 2^<sup>q</sup> = 2^<sup>(p-q)</sup>.
</pre>

<h3 id=sec_3_2_3>3.2.3&nbsp; The Keyboard Revealed</h3>

<p>We now plot all of the notes of the three above-derived
interlocking triads.  Due to the phenomenon of relative pitch, we
express each note as a ratio to the Root of the base Triad.  Due to
the phenomenon of octaves, we multiply or divide by 2 to keep all the
notes within one Octave.  Again, since we want the plot to mean
something, we take logarithms before we plot so that same
multiplicative ratios map to same additive increments.  We use 2 as
the base of our logarithm so that a factor of one Octave, or 2,
corresponds to an additive increment of 1, so all numbers will be
between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

<p>To review, the three fractions multiplied to obtain the fraction
for the note are in order: <ul>

  <li>which Major Triad: 1/1 for C, 3/2 for up a Fifth, 2/3 for down a
  Fifth,

  <li>which element of that Major Triad: 1/1 for Root, 5/4 for the
  Third (harmonic 5), 3/2 for the Fifth (harmonic 3),

  <li>multiply or divide by more factors of 2 to keep the result in
  the same Octave.

</ul>

<p>Multiplying all of that together and taking log base 2 we get the
following:

<pre>
    Base Major Triad
    Root:         (1/1) * (1/1) * (1/1) =  1/1;  log_2  1/1 ~ 0.000.
    Major Third:  (1/1) * (5/4) * (1/1) =  5/4;  log_2  5/4 ~ 0.322.
    Perfect Fifth:(1/1) * (3/2) * (1/1) =  3/2;  log_2  3/2 ~ 0.585.

    Major Triad up by a Perfect Fifth
    Root:         (3/2) * (1/1) * (1/1) =  3/2;  log_2  3/2 ~ 0.585.
    Major Third:  (3/2) * (5/4) * (1/1) = 15/8;  log_2 15/8 ~ 0.907.
    Perfect Fifth:(3/2) * (3/2) * (1/2) =  9/8;  log_2  9/8 ~ 0.170.

    Major Triad down by a Perfect Fifth
    Root:         (2/3) * (1/1) * (2/1) =  4/3;  log_2  4/3 ~ 0.415.
    Major Third:  (2/3) * (5/4) * (2/1) =  5/3;  log_2  5/3 ~ 0.737.
    Perfect Fifth:(2/3) * (3/2) * (1/1) =  1/1;  log_2  1/1 ~ 0.000.
</pre>

<p>Note that this may look more complicated than it really is.  All
that is going on numerically is playing with factors of 2, 3, and 5,
in a rather systematic way, as follows:<ul>

  <li>The three Triads are each a factor of 3 (a "Fifth") apart.

  <li>Within each Triad, we have a factor of 3 (a "Fifth") and a
  factor of 5 (a "Third") from the Root.

  <li>We multiply or divide by 2 (an "Octave") enough times to keep
  everything in one Octave.

  </ul>

<p>Notice that the importance of the numbers 2, 3, and 5 is not
uniform: 3 is used most prominently, 5 is more secondary, and, going
the other direction, 2 is so boring we just throw it in wherever we
like.  This reflects our observation from <a href='#sec_3_1_0'>Section 3.1</a> "The Major Triad" of
the different harmonics, a factor of 3 seems to have the right amount
of complexity to be most interesting, so it gets top billing (see
<a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity" for more on
interestingness in general).

<h4>Sorting and Plotting the Three Triads on One Line</h4>

<p>Now we sort the logarithms and remove duplicates.  Let's give them
letter names and for some strange reason let's start at C instead of A
and wrap around.

<pre>
    C: log_2  1/1 ~ 0.000.
    D: log_2  9/8 ~ 0.170.
    E: log_2  5/4 ~ 0.322.
    F: log_2  4/3 ~ 0.415.
    G: log_2  3/2 ~ 0.585.
    A: log_2  5/3 ~ 0.737.
    B: log_2 15/8 ~ 0.907.
</pre>

<p>Now let's plot them on the unit interval to within 0.02 units.

<pre>
    C       D       E    F       G       A       B    C
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0
</pre>

<p>Hmm, now that's interesting, if we were to fill in a few gaps they
would look almost evenly spaced.  Following music theory, we'll call
the big gaps "tones" (yes, this is a different meaning of the word
"tone") and the small gaps "semi-tones".  (This meaning of "tone" and
"semi-tone" will not occur very often, and below I try to use only
semi-tone.)  I'll fill in the big gaps with a hash sign (I'll omit
computing any exact values for them) so all the gaps are now
semi-tones.

<pre>
    C   #   D   #   E    F   #   G   #   A   #   B    C
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0
</pre>

<p>Does that look familiar?  If not, color the letters white and the
hashes black and look again at the picture of the keyboard at the top
of the article.

<p>Notice that there was no resorting to the following arguments:<ul>

  <li>"Because the Ancient Greeks did it this way."

  <li>"Because if the notes were equally spaced your ear would lose
  its place."

  <li>"Because your culture has trained these notes into your ear
    since you were a baby."

</ul>

The result emerged naturally just from some physics and some computer
science.

<p>After I made this derivation of the Major Triad from first
principles, a friend of mine Peter McCorquodale pointed me to
"Aesthetic Measure" by George D. Birkhoff [<span
class="cite">Birkhoff1933</span>].  On page 92 in the section "The
Natural Diatonic Scale", Birkhoff independently makes the same
derivation of the Major Scale as we do above, albeit providing less
detail and with no motivation from computer or brain science.  Given
the Major and Minor Triads, Helmholtz also seems to give the same
theory of a key as interlocking chords [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 300</span>] as we do above, though we
argue below that he fails to explain how it is that we find the Major
and Minor Triads compelling to listen to in the first place.

<p>While my derivation of the Major Scale above is therefore not a
completely original contribution, it is also certainly not well known.
It was quite an effort for me to invent it, given my starting point of
nothing but curiosity about the problem and disgust with all the books
to which I had access.  How is it that even music majors in college
not know this derivation of the Major Scale?

<h2 id=sec_3_3_0>3.3&nbsp; Scales and Keys</h2>

<p>The notes above are known as the 12-(Semi-)Tone Western (Chromatic)
Scale (you will hear people call it the "12-tone Western Scale",
including in quotations below).  The subset of lettered (or white)
keys, omitting the hashes (or black keys), is called the Major Scale.

<p>We can now explain some standard musical terminology.  In the
particular case of the C-triad, the note E is called the Major
<em>Third</em>, as it is the <em>third</em> white key in the Major
Scale.  Similarly, the note G is called the Perfect <em>Fifth</em>, as
it is the <em>fifth</em> white key.  Deep huh?  We defer discussion on
how it is that one is called "Major" and the other "Perfect" until the
section on Equal vs. Just Tuning below.

<p>Explaining all musical conventions is beyond the scope of this
article, but I mention a few basic ones we will need.  Going up a step
is called "sharp", denoted "#", and down "flat", denoted "b", so we
now have two names for each black key; for example the black key
between C and D is both "C#" and "Db".

<p>The "key" of the scale is the Root note of what we called the base
triad (the one in the middle of the three interlocking triads); that
is, in the example above the key was C Major.  It will turn out that
there is more than one way to build a scale than to lock together
those three Major Triads (F, C, G). <ol>

  <li> We could use a note other than C as the base of the center
  triad.

  <li> We could use another kind of triad other than the Major Triad;
  we haven't talked about that yet.

</ol> The name of the key indicates which choices were made for the
two variables above: the one we built above was built (1) starting at
C and (2) using three Major Triads (a Major Scale), so it is called
the C Major Scale.

<h3 id=sec_3_3_1>3.3.1&nbsp; Changing Key: Playing Other Groups of Triads</h3>

<p>The three interlocking triads we came up with have the Roots C, F,
and G.  Lots of music uses just these three triads; in fact

<blockquote><em>The entire genre of music called "Twelve-Bar Blues" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues">twelve-bb</a>]
basically uses only these three triads!</em></blockquote>

<p>In the hands of a skilled musician, these three triads of the Major
Scale can actually be interesting for quite a long time.  I once asked
my then Jazz piano teacher Ben Stolorow to give me more interesting
chord progressions to practice (so I wasn't just playing scales for
hours).  His response was that F/C/G was plenty interesting enough and
he demonstrated by simply arpeggio-ing these three chords (playing the
notes of a chord one at a time) while switching between different
rhythms [<span class="cite">Stolorow, c. 2006</span>]; I remember
saying "Wow, I would pay money just to listen to that and it's just
three chords!".

<p>If you enjoy playing notes that all lie within the three
interlocking triads we made, you will be just fine and dandy with the
group of notes above, which we call the Major Scale, and you will
never need the black keys on your piano.  However, after a while, just
as you got bored with one Major Triad, you might get bored with three
of them (though, per the above demo by my teacher, it might take
longer).  That is, if your melody is playing around in one Major
Scale, you might want to do the same playing around but all within a
different scale made starting with a different key note than C.
Making this change is called a "key change".

<p>For example, you might pick a key using two of the triads you have
already, C and G, but making G the base triad (instead of C as we did
above) and adding one more triad based at the Perfect Fifth above G
(which is D).  Uh, oh, we don't have all the notes for the D Major
Triad in our C Major Scale (the white keys).  You can repeat the
construction of the C Major Scale above and discover that the missing
note is F#.  This is how it emerges that piano players playing in a
Major Scale that is not C can still have to use some black keys.

<h3 id=sec_3_3_2>3.3.2&nbsp; Key Changes Break Harmony</h3>

<p>Adding F# to our keys can be done; however there is a worse
problem.  Let's compute the ratios we get if we build a Major Triad
starting at D, that is, using the notes D, F#, and A.  In particular,
if A is to be the Perfect Fifth above D, then their ratio should be
3/2.  (I kept so many decimal places below as the fractional part is
just too cool to omit.)

<pre>
    We got D as the Fifth above G, and G as the Fifth above C.
    (We divide by 2 to keep it in the same Octave:)
      D = (3/2) * (3/2) / 2 = (9/4) / 2     = 9/8.
    We got A as the Third above F, and F as the Fifth below C:
      A = (1/(3/2)) * (5/4) = (2/3) * (5/4) = 5/3.

    A over D is therefore
      A / D = (5/3) / (9/8) = (5*8)/(3*9) = 40/27 ~ 1.481.
    Whereas a Perfect Fifth should be        3/2  = 1.5.
    The error is therefore
      (PerfectFifth - (A/D)) / PerfectFifth
      = ((3/2) - (40/27)) / (3/2)
      ~ 0.0123456790123457
      ~ 1.2%.
</pre>

<p>So if we measure carefully, we notice that, even with the big gaps
filled in, the intervals are not all <em>exactly</em> right for
playing another key, such as D Major.  That is:<ul>

  <li>If we want to do a key change, we can try (a) just using the
  same piano we derived for the key of C Major, but (b) playing
  whatever piano keys we find when we just move "up" a triad; that is,
  using the same notes as for C Major but making the triad rooted at
  D.

  <li>However, if we compute the note ratios carefully, we see that
  the ratios for the "triad" rooted at D will not be quite right.  They
  also will not sound right.  In fact, if we do more key changes,
  moving, say, repeatedly "up" by a Perfect Fifth again (beyond D),
  some of the other triads will be even less right and will start to
  sound really bad.

</ul>

<p>Uh, oh. Should we buy a new piano every time we change key?

<h3 id=sec_3_3_3>3.3.3&nbsp; Just versus Equal Tuning</h3>

<p>There is no good solution to this problem, because there are more
constraints than variables to play with.  Engineers call this
situation "the problem is over-constrained".

<p>In the old days, there were many partial solutions proposed for
this problem [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning">mus</a>].  They all
amounted to fudging the actual note values so that instead of three
triads sounding really right and the rest pretty "off", some would
sound less right and others less off.  These different settings of the
frequencies of the note values were called different "tunings".

<p>The original tuning we computed in order to make triads F, C, and G
sound just right is called "Just Tuning" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation">just</a>] (for the
key of C anyway). It made the key of C Major sound great, but, as we
noticed above, also made the other keys sound not so great.  In the
past composers used this fact to artistic effect, deliberately
switching keys to make the music sound worse or better. In fact if you
go "up" by enough Perfect Fifths you come to a key that turns out to
be maximally bad (it can't keep getting worse because there are only
12 keys), namely the key of F# (also known as Gb). This key sounded so
bad it was called "the Wolf Key" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone_temperament#Wolf_intervals">wolf</a>].
Maybe people thought it sounded like a wolf howling.

<p>However, someone realized that if we just make all the steps
equally far apart, well, it sounds sort of ok once you get used to it.
From Wikipedia: "Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei) may have
been the first person to advocate equal temperament...." [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">eqt</a>]. Using
this system we can change key and it works out ok since all the gaps
are the same size. This is called "Equal Tuning (or
Temperament)". Notice that by making all the notes equally-spaced,
each semi-tone is the number such that when you multiply it by itself
12 times you get an Octave, or factor of 2.  This numbers is also
called twelfth-root of 2 which is 1.0594630943593 or one plus about
six percent.  That is, every time you go up a semi-tone, you are
adding six percent to the frequency of the note.  Below I'll call this
ratio of the interval of a semi-tone "TwR2" when I want to emphasize
that it is the twelfth-root of 2.

<p>Note that the Equal Tempered Chromatic Scale is commensurate with
our measure of interestingness from <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity".  That is, these twelve notes (1) maximize the
theme of being closed under arbitrary key changes and preserve the
theme of the Major Scale (as a subset of the twelve notes), while also
(2) having probably the right amount of complexity, namely twelve
notes, which Levitin points out later in <a href='#sec_4_2_0'>Section 4.2</a> "But Other Cultures Have Different Musical Scales!" seems to be a human universal for
scales (my guess is that's a limit on how much complexity the human
brain can handle).

<p>Equal Tuning is not considered to be a completely good thing.
First, now <em>none</em> of the keys are tuned really right -- now
they <em>all</em> sound a little "off" -- some of the sweetness is
permanently gone. Second, while all the keys sound the same, on the
other hand... all the keys sound the same!  (That is, "sound the same"
with respect to relative pitch considerations; Mark Hoemmen points out
that other factors of absolute pitch may still make keys sound
different [<span class="cite">Hoemmen, October 2011</span>].)  When
the notes were all tuned to make one key sound perfect, other keys
sounded "off" in different ways and this could be used for dramatic
effect by the composer; as a musician once pointed out to me, when we
play that old music today on a modern keyboard, we no longer hear it
as it was intended. By adopting the Equal Tempered Scale, as with all
engineering tradeoffs, something has been gained and something lost.

<blockquote><em>In our insistence on symmetry we have lost both some
sweetness and some richness -- a common theme of
Modernism.</em></blockquote>

<p>Recall that in, say, the C Major Scale, the Fifth is called
"Perfect" and the Third "Major". This is because the approximations
introduced by Equal Tuning caused more damage to the Third than the
Fifth.  Specifically the Fifth on an Equally Tempered piano is very
close to 3/2:

<pre>
    (TwR2^<sup>7</sup>) / (3/2) ~  0.998871 = 1 - 0.001129
      ~  1 - 0.1%.
</pre>

However the Third is not very close to 5/4:

<pre>
    (TwR2^<sup>4</sup>) / (5/4) ~  1.007937
      ~  1 + 0.8%.
</pre>

<p>You can actually hear the difference.

<blockquote> "Western music is fast because it's not in tune." --
Terry Riley [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning">mus</a>]
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that, due to the power of Relative Pitch, it seems to be
somewhat arbitrary exactly which note we pick to be C4, Middle C
(though not completely arbitrary: Middle C is in the middle of the
range of human hearing that has the best "tonal perception"; an easy
way to hear this is to play a dissonant interval very high or very low
on the keyboard; you will notice that it doesn't bother you).  For
specificity, from now on we speak of the Equal Tempered Scale with A3
at 220 Hz.  This is what in the West is called "concert pitch" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch">concert-pitch</a>],
but it varies geographically and historically [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)">pitch</a>].

<h2 id=sec_3_4_0>3.4&nbsp; The Minor</h2>

<p>Recall that we assumed that the brain wants to find a Harmonic
Series in what it hears.  Recall from <a href='#sec_2_5_0'>Section 2.5</a> "Recognition: Feature Vectors" that the brain is likely looking for the Harmonic Series by
looking for <em>features</em>.  We now consider what <em>different
kinds</em> of easily-computable features the Harmonic Series might
have that the brain might use to look for it.  Recall further from
<a href='#sec_2_2_0'>Section 2.2</a> "Artifacts of Optimization" that we assumed that the brain
uses two different tricks in order to recognize the many
<em>different</em> possible instances of the Harmonic Series (those
based on different fundamentals) using the <em>same</em> hardware and
using that hardware as <em>efficiently</em> as possible.  <ul>

  <li>Relative pitch: the brain divides pairs of co-occurring tones and
  recognizes the resulting pairwise intervals.

  <li>Octaves: the brain normalizes tones into a single factor of two
  range by dividing or multiplying up front by powers of two.

</ul>

<p>Octaves: when normalized into the Octave of the fundamental, the
Major Triad looks like this.

<pre>
    <span class="emph">Harmonics</span> of the Major Triad
    Root:            1 = 1.0.
    Major Third:   5/4 = 1.25.
    Perfect Fifth: 3/2 = 1.5.
</pre>

<p>Relative pitch: when expressed as a set of ratios of pairwise
intervals, the Major Triad looks like this.

<pre>
    <span class="emph">Intervals</span> of the Major Triad
    Major Third   / Root:        (5/4) / (1)   = 5/4.
    Perfect Fifth / Root:        (3/2) / (1)   = 3/2.
    Perfect Fifth / Major Third: (3/2) / (5/4) = 6/5.
</pre>

<h3 id=sec_3_4_1>3.4.1&nbsp; The Minor Triad</h3>

<p>Let's consider another set of notes, which we will call the "Minor
Triad" for a reason that will soon become clear.  When normalized into
the Octave of the fundamental, the Minor Triad looks like this.

<pre>
    <span class="emph">Harmonics</span> of the Minor Triad
    Root:            1 = 1.0.
    Minor Third:   6/5 = 1.2 (new!).
    Perfect Fifth: 3/2 = 1.5.
</pre>

<p>When expressed as a set of ratios of pairwise intervals, the Minor
Triad looks like this.

<pre>
    <span class="emph">Intervals</span> of the Minor Triad
    Perfect Fifth / Minor Third: (3/2) / (6/5) = 5/4.
    Perfect Fifth / Root:        (3/2) / (1)   = 3/2.
    Minor Third   / Root:        (6/5) / (1)   = 6/5.
</pre>

<p>Wow, with the Minor Triad <ul>

  <li>(Relative pitch) we <em>do</em> get the same set of ratios of
  pairwise intervals as the Major Triad,

  <li>(Octaves) but we do <em>not</em> get the whole triple of ratios
  when normalized into the Octave of the fundamental!

</ul>

<h3 id=sec_3_4_2>3.4.2&nbsp; The Minor as Auditory Cubism</h3>

<p>Now comes the art.  If the brain is hearing the series but also the
relative intervals, we can tease it, for artistic purposes, by giving
it the <em>right</em> intervals but in the <em>wrong</em> order.

<blockquote><em>The way the Minor Triad will sound to the brain is</em><ul>

  <li><em>I hear the pairwise intervals as the Harmonic Series,</em>

  <li><em>but I do not hear the Harmonic Series itself -- something is
missing.</em>

</ul></blockquote>

<p>Recall the discussion of Cubism from <a href='#sec_2_5_3'>Section 2.5.3</a> "Cubism: Partial Recognition Due to Redundant, Over-Determined Feature Vectors".
Doesn't that sound like a good description of how music in a Minor key
sounds?: "I recognize it, but something is off."  I conjecture this is
the same phenomenon as what happens when we look at cubist art: it's a
woman, but something is off.  Recall our conjecture from <a href='#sec_2_3_0'>Section 2.3</a> "Harmony: Sweetness is the Ideal" which suggests that the Major Triad
should sound sweet whereas the Minor Triad, while recognized, is "off"
and therefore not as sweet.

<p>In "Music and Probability" David Temperley [<span
class="cite">Temperley2007</span>] goes on at length wondering what
could make the Major and Minor scales sound happy and sad respectively
and does not mention this idea.  (Here we derive the scales from the
triads so we consider it to be the same question.)  Given the recent
publication date of January 2007, I suspect that this theory of the
difference between the feeling of the Major and Minor Triads may be
really an original contribution to science and art: that is, this may
be the first time in the history of Western Music that someone has
finally figured out how Major sounds right/happy and Minor sounds
off/sad.

<h3 id=sec_3_4_3>3.4.3&nbsp; Minor Scales</h3>

<p>While there is only one Major Scale, there are several different
scales all called some kind of Minor Scale [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale">min</a>].  <ul>

  <li>The Natural Minor consists of three Minor Triads linked together
  in the same way as we linked together three Major Triads to get the
  Major Scale.

  <li>The Major-Minor Scale which is a Major Triad, then a Minor Triad
  linked a Fifth above, then another Major Triad linked a Fifth above
  that.

  <li>There are more: Harmonic Minor Scale, Ascending Melodic Minor Scale,
  Descending Melodic Minor Scale.

</ul>

<p>Our theory of the Minor is that the Minor Scales are just games
with intervals where we tease the Harmonic Series recognizer of the
brain with partial recognition: <ul>

  <li>we fire some of the intervals in the feature vector for the
  Harmonic Series,

  <li>but not the whole series itself.

</ul>

<p>This theory is further re-enforced by the fact that there is
<em>one</em> Major Scale whereas there are <em>many</em> Minor scales.
Recall that in the Major Scale, built from the Major Triad, everything
goes "right", whereas in the Minor scales, built from the Minor Triad,
something is always "off" or "wrong".  It is a well-known engineering
adage that

<blockquote><em>There is one way for things to go right, but many ways
for things to go wrong.</em></blockquote>

<p>For example, in the Unix operating system each program upon exit
returns to the system a number.  In theory it could be used to mean
anything, but all of the tools of Unix are set up to enforce the
convention that the returned number be interpreted as an error code,
as follows: zero is the code meaning "ok" and any other number means
some kind of error occured (where the map from the number code to the
exact meaning of the error depends on the program returning the
number).  This convention works because of the above observation: the
one uniquely distinct number, namely zero, is the code meaning that
things went <em>the one way</em> for things to go right, and the rest
of the numbers encode <em>the many ways</em> that things can go wrong.

<p>Recall from <a href='#sec_2_3_0'>Section 2.3</a> "Harmony: Sweetness is the Ideal" our
conjecture that when things go right they sound sweet and anything
else gives us information to recognize a thing but also makes it
"off", not perfect.  We should expect therefore one way for things to
sound sweet, the one Major Scale reflecting the one ideal Harmonic
Series, and myriad ways for things to sound off in some way, resulting
in the multiple Minor Scales and other even stranger things (see
<a href='#sec_3_5_6'>Section 3.5.6</a> "Chords Preserving Intervals but not Harmonics").

<h2 id=sec_3_5_0>3.5&nbsp; Chords</h2>

<p>Musicians sometimes play multiple notes at the same time.  Likely
by trial and error, people have discovered that certain combinations
of notes convey a particular "emotion" or "sense" to the listener.
Notice I didn't say "sound good" -- in language we often use words
that don't sound good but still convey a certain sense, even if it is
bad.  That is, a musical sound should sound "like something", even if
not a good something.  Similarly, in written expression we may say
things good or bad, but we don't (often) say complete nonsense and
even if we do it is in a context that gives the nonsense some sort of
meta-sense.  Let's call these groups of notes that sound like
something "chords".

<p>Instead of resorting to trial and error to discover these chords,
let's see if we can derive them from our first principles and
conjectures, given above.  To make this a proper scientific experiment
we need a "ground truth" list of chords as a goal against which to
test our progress.  Many piano books come with a "chord dictionary"
which is a reasonable measure of the chords that people use most of
the time and that have been discovered by trial and error over the
centuries to sound like something; we'll use that.  Motivating
observed phenomena from the first principles of a theory is considered
to be an ultimate test of the quality of a theory (together with being
well-factored; see <a href='#sec_1_2_0'>Section 1.2</a> "What is a Satisfactory, <em>Scientific</em> Theory?"): if it succeeds, the theory has about
all of the explanatory power we could ever want.

<blockquote><em>Let's see if we can motivate from first principles all
of the chords in a Standard Chord Dictionary.</em></blockquote>

<p>Throughout this derivation of different chords, you will note that
a gradual progression or degradation from high-theme/low-complexity
(Major Triad, Harmonic Series chords) to low-theme/high-complexity
(Minor and Ambiguous chords).  This progression is suggested by our
measure of interestingness from <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity".  That is, as we progress, more and more of the theme of
the Harmonic Series is lost and more and more complexity is
introduced.  Notice that this progression seems to mirror that of
musical sophistication as well: musically untrained listeners like
Major chords while more musically trained listeners are more tolerant
to loss of theme and more interested in complexity.  (I met a signal
processing engineer who had played piano for something like 18 years
and who simply did not like Major chords at all.)  Other fields seem
to progress similarly: white wine is preferred by new wine drinkers,
whereas more "complex" red wines are an acquired taste.

<h3 id=sec_3_5_1>3.5.1&nbsp; The Standard Chord Dictionary</h3>

<p>Here are the chords in the chord dictionary of "How to Play from a
Fake Book" by Blake Neely [<span class="cite">Neely1999</span>]. We
give the notes on the C Major Scale and also in number of semi-tones
from the fundamental.  (You can reconstruct the chord with a different
Root than C-based version given here by playing the Root note for
semi-tone 0 and for the others counting the number semi-tones over
from the Root; note that to count semi-tones, count the keys across
the <em>top</em> of the keyboard where the black and white keys are
all the same width.  Also, you might want to play the Root (semi-tone
0) and the Fifth (semi-tone 7) in one Octave and the remaining notes
in the next Octave up; see <a href='#sec_3_5_2'>Section 3.5.2</a> "How to Turn Sweetness into Mud: Over-Using Octaves".)

<h3 id=sec_3_5_2>3.5.2&nbsp; How to Turn Sweetness into Mud: Over-Using Octaves</h3>

<p>Since you now have the formula to play any of these chords in any
key, I recommend playing them and asking yourself how they sound.
They certainly sound different and those differences are what our
theory is going to attempt to explain.

<p>Be careful about one point: as my then jazz piano teacher Ben
Stolorow pointed out to me (I'm paraphrasing) [<span
class="cite">Stolorow, c. 2006</span>]:

<blockquote>If you play all the notes of a chord within one Octave, it
sounds like mud.</blockquote>

<p>All of this dividing and multiplying of intervals by factors of two
as we move across Octaves has to stop someplace.  No such processing
of signals can be taken to an extreme: the more you do it the more it
corrupts the signal.

<p>Conversely, playing a chord across several Octaves, in particular
putting the Root on the bottom (keyboard left) and the higher
harmonics on the top (keyboard right), helps make the chord "ring"
beautifully.  In fact, selecting which Octaves in which to play the
notes of a chord is so important it has a term: <em>voicing</em> the
chord.

<p>To hear this effect for yourself find a keyboard and try playing C
Major, C-E-G, across multiple Octaves such that there are no factors
of two in the denominator:<ul>

  <li>Harmonic 1: so as to not get too high you probably want to play
  the Root, C, one Octave below Middle C (C3 in Scientific Pitch
  Notation [<a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation">sci-pitch</a>]).

  <li>Harmonic 3: play the Fifth, G, one Octave up from the Root (G4):
  from the Root this interval is a factor of (3/2) * 2 = 3.

  <li>Harmonic 5: play the Third, E, two Octaves up from the Root
  (E5): a factor of (5/4) * 4 = 5.

  </ul>

<p>If you really want to make it ring fill in these other notes from
the Harmonic Series of C in their proper Octaves -- you can just do it
with two hands if they can span an Octave:<ul>

  <li>Harmonic 2: play the Octave interval, C4, one Octave up from the
  Root: a factor of 2.

  <li>Harmonic 4: play the "Double-Octave", C5, two Octaves up from
  the Root: a factor of 2 * 2 = 4.

  <li>Harmonic 6: play the "Double-Octave-Fifth", G5, two Octaves up
  from the Root: a factor of (3/2) * 2 * 2 = 6.

</ul>

<p>Since playing the notes of a chord in Octaves that put them closer
to the ideal Harmonic Series really sounds better, this experiment
supports the theory that notes sound good together because they are
all from one Harmonic Series, rather than because their intervals are
just somehow special.

<p>However, I would be remiss if I did not point out the following
phenomenon (I recall Michael O'Donnell making this point to me, but he
does not recall making it) [<span class="cite">O'Donnell, c. January
2009</span>]:<ul>

  <li>even if you <em>invert</em> the chord -- select an alternate
  voicing, say with the Root high (keyboard right) and other harmonics
  low (keyboard left),

  <li>but are sure to play the notes across several Octaves anyway,

</ul> then the chord <em>stills sounds better</em> than if played all
in one Octave, though I think perhaps it doesn't quite "ring" as
nicely; try it for yourself.  This observation may dampen the ringing
endorsement of the Harmonic Series of the above paragraph (puns
intended): it seems that even in the absence of the ideal Harmonic
Series (due to the chord inversion), the brain would still rather hear
notes played across several Octaves rather than all bunched into one.

<p>Having said that, we now begin our plan to derive the Standard
Chord Dictionary from our theory.

<h3 id=sec_3_5_3>3.5.3&nbsp; Chords from the Harmonic Series</h3>

<p>First, let's try playing the six notes having Roots corresponding
to the first six overtones in the Harmonic Series (recall from <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes" that the ratios of the notes will
induce the vertical ratios of their composite tones). Well, as we saw
in <a href='#sec_3_1_0'>Section 3.1</a> "The Major Triad" above, we just get the Major Triad (as a
chord, that's C Major in the chart above).

<p>Recall however that during the derivation of the Major Triad we
stopped at harmonic 6. What if we keep going? Well we find that no
note in our Twelve-Semi-Tone Scale is terribly close to 7/8. This is
just the way the math works out: if we want enough things, sometimes
we just don't get them all -- again, engineers call this an
over-constrained (or over-determined) system. In this situation we'll
just pick a key on one side or the other of the real 7/8. Fudging
downward is the closer approximation and that is likely the purpose in
it being called the "Dominant Seventh"; in the key of C the Dominant
Seventh is Bb. Michael O'Donnell insists that this interval is not
properly called the Dominant Seventh, but the "Minor Seventh" [<span
class="cite">O'Donnell, 18 January 2009</span>]; however I have
retained the term "Dominant Seventh" for this fudged-down interval as
(1) that is the term used to distinguish chords that use this note as
their seventh, (2) to call it Minor would confusingly introduce a
second meaning to the word "Minor", and (3) even more confusingly,
there is a chord called the "Minor Seventh" that employs a Minor Third
interval and a Dominant Seventh interval!

<p>Interestingly, fudging upward produces an interval called the
"Major Seventh"; in the key of C the Major Seventh is B. This makes
sense once we notice that the Dominant Seventh is not in the Major
Scale (is not a white key in the key of C) whereas the Major Seventh
is in the Major Scale. In the key of C the Major Seventh is
B. However, O'Donnell points out that this explanation of the Major
Seventh interval may be a red herring and the use of the Major Seventh
interval may have nothing to do with its being close to the seventh
harmonic; that is, the Major Seventh <em>interval</em> may make no
sense outside of the context of an effect that arises when it is used
as part of the Major Seventh <em>chord</em> [<span
class="cite">O'Donnell, c. April 2009</span>]; please see the
discussion of the Major Seventh chord in <a href='#sec_3_5_6'>Section 3.5.6</a> "Chords Preserving Intervals but not Harmonics" where we discuss this situation further.

<p>You can read a discussion on several kinds of seventh intervals
here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh">min7</a>]
and [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh">harmonic7</a>]. From
that discussion it seems that the <em>exact</em> ratio 7/4 (not the
fudged-downward Dominant Seventh or the fudged-upward Major Seventh)
is called the "Harmonic Seventh" (at least when it's not being called
the "Septimal Minor Seventh", or the "Subminor Seventh"!).

<p>A chord containing harmonic 7 is called a seventh chord because B
is the seventh white key counting from C (and Bb is the flatted
version of B), and not because it is harmonic number 7 in the Harmonic
Series.  Recall that the Perfect Fifth is actually harmonic 3 and the
Major Third is actually the harmonic 5!  This convenient naming of the
seventh white key being harmonic 7 is however just a coincidence!
That is, in the case of seven we are just lucky.  (Get it?  Lucky
seven!  Nevermind.)  It turns out that this lucky correspondence of
the two numbers of (a) the white key count from the Root, and (b) the
overtone harmonic number in the Harmonic Series continues on for all
of the rest of the subsequent harmonics above seven as well
(approximately well enough anyway and up until we stop at harmonic 13;
more on this below).

<p>Let's add some more notes to our chord just by going up the
Harmonic Series.  Harmonic 8 is just the Root again if we divide by
two enough times; for this reason in general we will skip even numbers
from now on (to find the interval for an even harmonic just divide by
two until you get an odd number).  For a harmonic N times the
fundamental the number of semi-tones to the right of the Root key on a
Equal Tempered 12-semi-tone keyboard is log N / log TwR2 (recall that
"TwR2" denotes the twelfth-root of 2).  Of course we subtract off any
extra multiples of 12 to keep it in the same Octave; another way to do
that is divide up-front by a high-enough power of 2.  (This
computation differs from the ones done earlier taking logs base 2 in
<a href='#sec_3_2_3'>Section 3.2.3</a> "The Keyboard Revealed" because in that section we wanted the
answer as a percentage of the Octave (a factor of 2), whereas here we
now know that we have divided the Octave into 12 semi-tones and
instead want the answer as the number of semi-tones; we could just as
easily instead take the log_2 x as before and then multiply by 12.)

<pre>
    Ninth        9/8 = 1.125;  log 1.125 / log TwR2 ~ 2.039.
    Eleventh    11/8 = 1.375;  log 1.375 / log TwR2 ~ 5.513.
    Thirteenth  13/8 = 1.625;  log 1.625 / log TwR2 ~ 8.405.
</pre>

<p>Hmm, well those eleventh and thirteenth harmonics are pretty badly
approximated by the piano keyboard!  Hey, wait a minute!  I thought
earlier we were saying that the names of the intervals were the number
of white keys we had to count over from the Root, not the name of the
harmonic number.  Remember, harmonic 3 is the fifth white key and
harmonic 5 is the third white key.

<p>As noted above, just by coincidence harmonic 9 is really the ninth
white key: 12 + 2 = D above C. It basically works out, if we fudge
just a little, that harmonic 11 is the eleventh white key: 12 + 5
(round down instead of up!) = 17 = F (also known as the 4th). Harmonic
13 is the thirteenth white key: 12 + 9 (round up instead of down!) =
21 = A (also known as the 6th). Very conveniently, with these
fudgings, these harmonics just fit in between the Major Triad white
keys. How nice, especially if we don't let the pesky mathematical
precision bother us.  Be sure to play the higher harmonics in higher
Octaves, as detailed in <a href='#sec_3_5_2'>Section 3.5.2</a> "How to Turn Sweetness into Mud: Over-Using Octaves" below.

<p>And what about the harmonic 15 and higher?  I don't know if people
can even hear harmonic 15, as it is also the Major Seventh -- the
brain may simply start to hear lower harmonics instead.  Also,
remember that my goal is to explain the chords in my chord dictionary
and it doesn't go higher than a Major Thirteenth.  I don't know if
people can hear harmonics 11 or 13 either, but note that by stopping
at harmonic 13 each odd interval neatly corresponds one-to-one with a
white key on the keyboard; that is, the fact that the chord dictionary
stops at harmonic 13 may be another consequence of people's desire for
symmetry (also, harmonic 15 is not the "fifteenth" white key, which
would instead be the Double-Octave).

<pre>
    Harmonic    15/8 = 1.875;  log 1.875 / log TwR2 ~ 10.883, which is B.

<h3 id=sec_3_5_4>3.5.4&nbsp; Chords Inducing Ambiguity</h3>

<p>"How to Play From a Fake Book" [<span
class="cite">Neely1999</span>] says that when playing, say, a
thirteenth chord, that after the 7th note one should just omit any
notes before we get to the thirteenth -- that is, omit the ninth and
eleventh. Further he says if it is too hard for your hand to play
that, then drop the Root or <em>even the Fifth</em>.  Given that the
Root is, well, the root of the chord, somehow like its foundation, I
was astounded when I first read this; it seemed as if someone were
suggesting to me that we not bother to build the basement and first
storey of a house and instead start by building the second storey in
mid-air.  We explain this situation simply as follows: <ul>

<li>Recall from <a href='#sec_2_2_1'>Section 2.2.1</a> "Relative Pitch: Differences Between Sounds"
that relative pitch is making us hear <em>differences</em> between
tones, even series-es of tones each induced by a note in a chord.

<li>Recall from <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes" that ratios
of notes induces <em>vertical</em> ratios of their overtones.
  
<li>Recall from <a href='#sec_2_1_1'>Section 2.1.1</a> "Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There" that virtual pitch will fill in a missing
fundamental tone of an overtone series, it will also fill in other
missing tones near the Root, such as harmonics 2 and 3.

</ul>

<p>Therefore when listening to a chord, relative pitch on the induced
vertical intervals makes us hear an artificial Harmonic Series that is
missing a Root or even a Fifth, but then virtual pitch fills those
tones; that is, inducing us to hear the missing Root or Fifth note of
the chord.

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Ten</strong>: The brain wants to hear
<em>one</em> Harmonic Series (which can be seen as Conjecture Seven in
<a href='#sec_2_4_1'>Section 2.4.1</a> "The Simplicity of Theme" applied to Conjecture Three in
<a href='#sec_2_1_0'>Section 2.1</a> "Searching for Harmonics").</blockquote>

<p>If we leave out more and more notes and the brain is filling in
more and more, we can start to get really close to barely playing
enough notes for the brain to figure out which Harmonic Series it is
supposed to be listening to.  What if we play so few notes that the
implied Harmonic Series is ambiguous, that the missing Harmonic Series
could be completed in more than one way?

<p>Some chords are ambiguous therefore unstable: if we give the brain
more than one alternative then the sound is is "unsettled" until the
player provides enough notes to "break symmetry" and disambiguate the
series.  Many standard chords are of this kind as we will see as we
enumerate a taxonomy of the ways we can tease the brain with
ambiguity.

<p><em>Suspended (Sus):</em> One ambiguity is to have two instances of
the interval from Root to harmonic 3, the Perfect Fifth.  For example,
if we play notes C, F and G, we create the possibility of either F or
C being the Root.  This chord is called the "Suspended" chord and
musicians say that something is unfinished or up-in-the-air about it
and it "wants" to "resolve" to a Major Triad at F or C.  This effect
is very easy to hear.  Try it: play C-F-G (C Suspended) and then play
C-E-G (C Major).  A note on the name [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_chord">sus</a>]:

<blockquote>
The term is borrowed from the contrapuntal technique of suspension,
where a note from a previous chord is carried over to the next chord,
and then resolved down to the third or tonic, suspending a note from
the previous chord. However, in modern usage, the term concerns only
the notes played at a given time; in a suspended chord the added tone
does not necessarily resolve, and is not necessarily "prepared" (i.e.,
held over) from the prior chord.
</blockquote>

<p>That is, the name "Suspended" is a red herring: the effect of
feeling somehow unresolved or up-in-the-air and then resolving when
followed by the corresponding major triad is not a <em>temporal</em>
effect, one of one note of a chord being held over from a previous
chord in time, instead it is a <em>harmonic</em> effect.  In the first
version of this article I called this chord by what is evidently a
common "incorrect" term for it, "Sustained".  (A note to terminology
crazies: these terms are all made up.)  When this was first pointed
out to me I considered leaving it unchanged, due to the suspension
metaphor being a red herring, but eventually I had to admit that
sustaining something is just about a synonym for suspending something,
and therefore it is no better: consider that in Latin they mean,
respectively, "under hang" vs "under hold" and both are used in
English, and in particular in music, to mean to somehow "hold over
time".  Therefore I considered that a standard wrong term was better
than a non-standard term that was just as wrong and so I changed it.
Given the structure of the Sus chord as a simultaneous occurrence of
two fifths, which is the flagship interval of the Major Triad, a
better term would be one somehow indicating a "double lead", so maybe
something like "Duo Primo".  Alas, the chance I'm going to get that
changed is small.

<p><em>Augmented:</em> Another ambiguity is to have two instances of
the interval from Root to harmonic 5, the Major Third.  For example, if
we play notes C, E and G# we have this situation.  Counting carefully,
note that these three notes actually make three Major Thirds!
Unsurprisingly, it doesn't sound very satisfying, but the brain does
"recognize it as something", as opposed to sounding like noise.

<p><em>Diminished:</em> Another ambiguity we can create is to have two
instances of the Minor Third. For example, if we play notes C, Eb and
Gb we have this situation and if we add the note A, we have not only
three but four (they wrap around) copies of this interval all at once!
Unsurprisingly, it also doesn't sound very satisfying, but again it
still sounds "like something".

<h3 id=sec_3_5_5>3.5.5&nbsp; Chords Using the Minor Triad</h3>

<p>Similar to the way we extended the Major Triad to a family of
chords, we can also make more chords by adding more notes from the
Harmonic Series on top of this Minor Triad, producing chords such as
Minor (Dominant) 7, etc.

<p>What about the C6 chord: C-E-G-A. What the heck is that A doing in
the Chord Dictionary? This chord is <em>called</em> C6 because it is
the C Major Triad plus the 6th white key starting from C, that is, A.
However thinking of the chord that way that seems to be a red herring.
At my (then) girlfriend's house I started discussing this theory with
her musician father Tim and he pointed out to me that C6 is
<em>also</em> the same set of notes as the Minor (Dominant) 7 chord
when rooted at A (instead of C); that is, the 6th forms a Minor Third
with C [<span class="cite">Turner, c. 2006</span>]. (Again, such a
rearrangement of the same notes in a different Octaves is called an
"inversion").

<p>During that discussion with Tim I also told him about my efforts to
learn absolute pitch by attempting to guess Middle C every morning and
then checking my guess on the keyboard.  I never seemed to hit it, but
I was getting closer and got to the point where I was predictably
within maybe four semi-tones (again, after having just woken up).  He
seemed to take this as a claim that I <em>could</em> pick Middle C out
of my head and said, "let's try it."  I thought it would be wimpy to
back down, especially in front of my girlfriend, and I really wanted
to impress my girlfriend's father, so I said "let's see" and hummed a
note that sounded right.  He matched my note and went to the other
room to check on the piano.  He came back "yup, you got it right on,"
looking a little impressed.  I never told him that that was the first
and only time I had ever pulled that off.

<h3 id=sec_3_5_6>3.5.6&nbsp; Chords Preserving Intervals but not Harmonics</h3>

<p>However there is another seventh chord called the Major Seventh; in
C, it is C-E-G-B (no flat on the B).  For what purpose do we even
bother calling this group of notes a chord? Does it sound "like
something"? Try it yourself; to get the effect best, put at least two
of the notes one Octave above the other two, say the E and the B.

<p>Perhaps the fact that it is called a "seventh" is a red herring:
that is, perhaps the seventh in the chord is not interesting because
it is harmonic seven of the fundamental. Perhaps it is there for
another reason. As Ben Stolorow also pointed out to me [<span
class="cite">Stolorow, c. 2006</span>]:

<blockquote><em>The Third and the Seventh of a Major Seventh chord
form a <span class="emph">second</span> Perfect Fifth
interval.</em></blockquote>

<p>In fact, there is a <em>square</em> of Fifths and Thirds:

<pre>
      C -- Fifth -- G
      |             |
      |             |
    Third         Third
      |             |
      |             |
      E -- Fifth -- B
</pre>

Note that there are two sub Triads, one Major and one Minor:

<ul>

  <li>The C Major Triad.

  <li>The E Minor Triad.

</ul>

<p>The Major Seventh has always had a "cool Jazz" sound to me -- I can
hear something, it is a bit of a thin, distant flavor having just a
hint of sweetness -- like one of those drinks in an upscale organic
juice bar that you've never heard of -- I'm thinking celery and
watermelon rind with a touch of pomegranate.

<p>But then what about C Minor (Dominant) 7?  It doesn't seem to fit
into any Harmonic Series no matter how I look at it.  There are also
other many other weird chords that occur in Jazz pieces that are too
rare to make it into my chord dictionary but show up in actual music,
such as C7#5: C Dominant 7 with a sharped 5th.  There are two things
all of these chords have in common<ul>

<li>they are relatively rare, and

<li>they sound rather weird and off, even more so than a Minor Triad
(probably related to the fact that they are rare!).

</ul>

<p>Explanation?  They are probably all just fragments of various sets
of intervals that occur in the Harmonic Series, with no attempt to
actually represent the series, or they combine that with some Harmonic
Series ambiguity as does the Minor Triad above.  We discuss a possible
further effect in <a href='#sec_7_2_0'>Section 7.2</a> "The Role of Narrative Generally" where we
consider the importance of content providing context for further
content, thereby creating narrative.  In sum, it is likely that the
brain has one disambiguation engine and that the processing that
occurs in verbal narrative would process similarly in other contexts,
such as music.  So, while these chords may sound strange in isolation,
the theme created by the preceding music before the chord may bring a
certain sense to them.  Think of one standard structure for a joke: a
story (creating a theme) and then a punchline; the punchline would not
be funny in isolation without the context provided by the story, and
yet we attribute the funniness of the joke to the punchline and not
the story which did the work.  Theme and ambiguity may alternate
throughout a narrative, repeating this effect.  Investigating this
process is left as future work.

<hr><br/>
<h1 id=sec_4_0_0>4&nbsp; Miscellaneous Objections</h1>

<p>Here are my thoughts on a few objections that I anticipate.

<h2 id=sec_4_1_0>4.1&nbsp; But what about the Circle of Fifths!</h2>

<p>Some readers who have been abused since childhood by music "theory"
have pointed out to me that I have entirely omitted any mention of the
"Circle of Fifths".  They are right.  First of all, what is this
Circle anyway?

<h3 id=sec_4_1_1>4.1.1&nbsp; Fifths make a Circle</h3>

<p>If you start at, say, Middle C, and go up by a Fifth you get to G.
If you keep going in this manner but be sure to stay within a single
Octave by sometimes (about every-other time) dropping down by an
Octave (which of course retains the same note name, since note names
cycle every Octave), then eventually <ul>

  <li>the notes will repeat and you will come back to Middle C, and

  <li>you will have visited every note in the Western
  Twelve-(Semi-)Tone Scale exactly once along the way.

</ul>

<p>(You visit every note because a Fifth is 7 half-steps, the Octave
is 12 half-steps, and 7 is "relatively prime" to 12: they have no
common divisors.)

<p>This sequence is called the "Circle of Fifths" and is so important
to know as a musician that I have spent a so long drilling it into my
head that I will type it in now from memory without hesitation.  (Note
that, given that the C Major Scale is the F, C, and G Major Triads
linked together at Fifths, you get the cleanest presentation in C
Major by starting one Fifth below C, at F; note further that splitting
the sequence across two lines emphasizes an internal almost-symmetry
with sharps):

<pre>
    F   C   G   D   A   E   B
    F#  C#  G#  D#  A#  (...and then repeats: E# = F).
</pre>

<p>Cool!

<p>As we saw above, of all the intervals, the Fifth is the most <ul>

  <li>sweet (near the bottom of the Harmonic Series), and

  <li>interesting (not so harmonic as to be boring; that is, not the
  Octave interval).

</ul>

<p>As we discuss in the next section, by using the Fifth (and, well,
of course the Octave) repeatedly we get all the notes on our piano!
This Circle of Fifths thing must be fundamentally important to the
nature of how sounds sound musical or something!

<h3 id=sec_4_1_2>4.1.2&nbsp; The Circle of Fifths is Just a Combinatorial Coincidence</h3>

<p>Nope.  The Circle of Fifths is not fundamental or important or
anything to the nature of sounds sounding musical.  The Circle of
Fifths is just a huge red herring that prevents people from
understanding harmony, or at least how it is that harmony <em>sounds
good</em>.

<p>The Circle is just a combinatorial coincidence.  We went up by a
Fifth, a factor of 3/2, twelve times, and if you count carefully we
went down by an Octave, a factor of 1/2, an additional seven times,
and we got back to the "same" note, or a ratio to that same note that
is very close to one (actually within 1.4%).  In other words, we have
discovered that:

<pre>
    3^<sup>12</sup> = 531441
      almost equals
    2^<sup>19</sup> = 524288;

    that is,
    3^<sup>12</sup> / 2^<sup>19</sup>
      = 1.0136432647705078125 (exact!)
</pre>

<p>Wow is that close to 1.  When that small amount of error is spread
out evenly over twelve Fifth intervals, you can see how the Equally
Tempered Scale is rather appealing: it gets Fifths almost exactly
right, to within almost a tenth of a percent:

<pre>
    ((3^<sup>12</sup> / 2^<sup>19</sup>) - 1) / 12
      = 0.0136432647705078125 / 12
      ~ 0.0011369387308756511
      ~ 0.1%.
</pre>

<p>By the way, if you write a computer program to look for other
amazingly-close collisions of powers of two and three with reasonably
low exponents (I have), you won't find any.

<p>Amazingly, (1) picking twelve notes makes the most important
harmonic, number 3, be the fifth white key, and (2) humans have five
fingers on one hand, making the most important harmonic also the one
that is easiest to play.

<h3 id=sec_4_1_3>4.1.3&nbsp; The Circle of Fifths Allows for Cool Chord Transitions</h3>

<p>The amazing fact of the existence of the Circle does not explain
how it emerges that chords <em>sound good</em>, however it is still
cool because it does allow you play around with chords in fun ways, as
follows.

<p>A "chord transition" is playing one chord and then another (or
playing in sequence notes from one and then the other -- see the
discussion of melody and harmony in <a href='#sec_7_0_0'>Section 7</a> "Future Work: Towards A Unifying Theory of Music").  Musicians would often like to make
transitions between chords that are not too jarring, or sound
"natural".  One really common way to do this is for the second chord
to have as its Root a note of the first chord, such as the Fifth (as
we did above when constructing the Major Scale, going from C Major to
G Major) or Third, or to do the reverse (as when going from C Major to
F Major).  Note that while we call it the Circle of Fifths, really
it's just another way of looking at the Western 12-Tone Scale, which
also contains Circle(s) of other intervals such as Thirds.  The basic
point of the coolness of the Circle of Fifths is the fun you can have
with chord transitions. <ul>

  <li>You can repeatedly make transitions from one chord to another
  using the three natural intervals of the Major and Minor Triads --
  Fifths (and their inverse, Fourths), Major Thirds, Minor Thirds --
  and you will not fall out of the twelve notes generated by the
  Circle -- well, you won't if you use if you use an Equal Tempered
  Tuning anyway, or if you fudge some of the notes along the way --
  recall that the Thirds don't work out so well in Equal Temperament.

  <li>Notice that moving by either a Fifth (or equivalently, a
  Fourth), a Major Third, or a Minor Third, you get you to different
  places on the Circle, and therefore by combining these different
  transitions, you can go one direction in the "harmonic space", and
  come back by <em>another direction!</em>.

</ul>

<p>This kind of thing is what allows musicians to make interesting
chord progressions, which are a fundamental aspect of Western (and
likely all) music.  Just look at a Jazz Fake Book (see [<span
class="cite">Neely1999</span>]) and you will see the essence of a
piece pared down to the minimum: it consists of a chord progression, a
melody line, some rhythm, and maybe some lyrics.  But it is clear that
the chord progression and rhythm are more fundamental than the melody:
I have twice now asked two different Jazz pianists, after they had
just finished a piece, "When you are improvising while playing, what
are you really doing?"  Both times I got the same answer "I know the
melody, and I'm not playing it."  The only way to be playing something
that goes with the melody is to play a different set of notes that are
<em>harmonically</em> related to the melody, and, of course, in a
related rhythm.

<h3 id=sec_4_1_4>4.1.4&nbsp; The Symmetries of the Circle of Fifths are a Terrible Red Herring</h3>

<p>Michael O'Donnell points out the chord progression possibilities
here (addressed to me) [<span class="cite">O'Donnell, 14 January
2009</span>]:

<blockquote>

Many years ago, there was an article in the Computer Music Journal
about the value of the diatonic scale as a subset of the 12-tone
chromatic scale. The article dealt entirely with group-theoretic
structural properties of the notes under the half-step and
perfect-fifth generators. It deliberately left out
acoustical/perceptual issues. I think that there is something to learn
from this structural study, and from connecting it to
acoustical/perceptual issues, even though the authors did not even
claim to have solved some defined problem. Roughly speaking, while you
go into reasons why the major and minor thirds sound nice, this
article discussed why they yield a lot of structurally interesting
harmonic progressions.

</blockquote>

<p>Using symmetries to create chord progressions may be interesting,
however no amount of symmetries is going to explain how it works that
the Fifth sounds good <em>in and of itself</em>; that is, no one wants
interesting chord progressions made out of chords that don't sound
like anything.  As people love symmetry so much, the Circle of Fifths
makes for a powerful red herring.  Don't fall for it.  Mark [<span
class="cite">Hoemmen, 22 October 2011</span>] again:

<blockquote>

The issue there is that circle of fifths transitions have become
perhaps a cultural expectation[.]  So there's an interaction between
what people expect culturally, vs. what their brains expect
biologically.

</blockquote>

<h2 id=sec_4_2_0>4.2&nbsp; But Other Cultures Have Different Musical Scales!</h2>

Many people object to a universal theory of music and claim that it is
all "culturally relative".  Such people aren't really paying
attention, and more evidence will likely be needed to convince them.
From [<a href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">Levitin2006,
p. 37</a>]:

<blockquote>

Nearly all this variation in context and sound comes from different
ways of dividing up the octave and, in virtually every case we know
of, dividing it up into no more than twelve tones.  Although it has
been claimed that Indian and Arab-Persian music use "microtuning" --
scales with intervals much smaller than a semitone -- close analysis
reveals that their scales also rely on twelve or fewer tones and the
others are simply expressive variations, glissandos (continuous glides
from one tone to another), and momentary passing tones, similar to the
American blues tradition of sliding into a note for emotional
purposes.

</blockquote>

<p>The choice of twelve notes to a scale is likely to simply be the
amount of complexity that the brain can handle in its note-expectation
engine. A scale (such as the C Major Scale) consists of several
interlocking or overlapping chords between which one can move while
playing notes. However if the brain really wants to expect and predict
some outcomes, too many notes makes that too hard.  Recall our
discussion in <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity"; also see
<a href='#sec_7_2_0'>Section 7.2</a> "The Role of Narrative Generally" below where we discuss how
theme and ambiguity are used together to create narrative.

<h3 id=sec_4_2_1>4.2.1&nbsp; A Culture May Simply not be Fully Exploiting All of the Universal Harmonic Features</h3>

<p>Suppose the music of another culture is missing some important
feature emerging from our canonical derivation of chords and harmony.
Does that mean the music of that culture is a counter-example to our
argument? Maybe not: just because the brain is capable of experiencing
something does not mean that the art of that culture has taken
advantage of that fact.

<p>That is, the situation could be as follows:<ul>

  <li>The brain is listening for certain canonical patterns induced by
  the Harmonic Series.

  <li>The brain induces processing artifacts such as relative pitch
  (listening for the ratios between tones/notes) and octaves
  (listening for tones/notes normalized by factors of 2).

  <li>The brain is listening for parts of a feature vector firing.

</ul>

<p>However, a culture may not <em>fully</em> exploit <em>all</em> of
these features in its tradition.  An engineer might say that features
above that we claim to be universal to human hearing define the
<em>shape of the parameter space</em>, but a particular design need
not make use of the whole space.

<p>Many cultures use only five notes in their scale; any such scale is
called "Pentatonic" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale">pen</a>]. For
example, one of these Pentatonic scales is the Major Pentatonic: the
set of notes we get by starting at one note and going around the
Circle of Fifths four more times, resulting in five notes (starting
with C, that would be C, G, D, A, E). From [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale">pen</a>]:

<blockquote>
Pentatonic scales are very common and are found all over the world....
</blockquote>

<p>Much African and Chinese music makes use of Pentatonic scales and
yet African and Chinese people seem to have no difficulty enjoying
Western music.  Their brains were always capable of hearing Western
music, but their culture has simply never made use of the rest of the
available parameter space.

<h3 id=sec_4_2_2>4.2.2&nbsp; But The Nasca People Of Peru Use A Linear, Not A Logarithmic, Scale!</h3>

<p>From [<span class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 18</span>],
"Logarithmic and Linear Frequency Scales":

<blockquote>

<p>A musical scale is a succession of notes arranged in ascending or
descending order. Most musical composition is based on scales, the
most common ones being those with five notes (pentatonic), twelve
notes (chromatic), or seven notes (major and minor diatonic, Dorian
and Lydian modes, etc.). Western music divides the Octave into 12
steps called semitones. All the semitones in an Octave constitute a
chromatic scale or 12-tone scale. However, most music makes use of a
scale of seven selected notes, designated as either a major scale or a
minor scale and carrying the note name of the lowest note. For
example, the C-major scale is played on the piano by beginning with
any C and playing white keys until another C is reached.

<p>Other musical cultures use different scales. The pentatonic or
five-tone scale, for example, is basic to Chinese music but also
appears in Celtic and Native American music. A few cultures, such as
the Nasca Indians of Peru, have based their music on linear scales
(Haeberli, 1979), but these are rare. Most music is based on
logarithmic (steps of equal frequency ratio &Delta;f / f) rather than
linear (steps of equal frequency &Delta;f) scales.

<p>In this demonstration we compare both 7-step diatonic and 12-step
chromatic scales with linear and logarithmic steps.

</blockquote>

<p>Who knows what is going on with the linear scales of the Nasca. I
suspect the following.<ul>

  <li> Linear-scale flutes are easy to make as the lengths of the
  tubes of a linear-scale pan-flute are increasing linearly, rather
  than exponentially; in contrast, to make, say, a pan flute you must
  make tube of exponentially-related lengths, which is probably quite
  unintuitive the first time someone has to work that out.

  <li> This culture was small and isolated and so no one ever noticed
  harmony and no one nearby showed it to them; that is, innovation
  seems likely to be proportional to the number of people available to
  have new ideas, but notice that the interesting number here is the
  number of people who are all in communication with one another.

</ul>

<p>Let's consider the cultural evolution of visual instead of auditory
processing for a moment. Cultures introduce color names in an almost
deterministic fashion. From [<span class="cite">Feldman2006,
p. 102-103</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>Berlin and Kay (Berlin et al. 1969) showed that, in languages
around the world, basic color terms had essentially the same focal
colors, even though boundaries around color categories varied. The
neurophysiology of color vision was seen as directly providing the
best explanation. There are now a number of competing explanations for
the commonality of focal colors, but the are all based on embodiment
(Kay et al. 2005).

<p>... In the 1950s, color names were believed to be arbitrary in
different languages. The assumption was that you couldn't predict the
ranges of these different color terms. Paul Kay and Brent Berlin did a
study in which they asked whether the boundaries of color terms were
and also what colors from a color chart where the best examples of
each term. Between their own experiments and the literature, they
surveyed about 100 languages. They found that the boundaries for
different languages were somewhat different, but the best examples
where quite similar. This study has since been greatly expanded and
the basic result confirmed (Kay et al. 2005).

<p>... There is also considerable evidence on how the color word
system evolves over time -- usually when its community encounters
other languages. Figure 8.1 outlines the development as speakers of a
language (like Dani) that has only two color words come to express
further distinctions. Systematically, when a third word is added, it
distinguishes white from warm; a fourth term will separate black from
cool, and so on. Since this progression appears to hold very widely,
it is rather further evidence that human color terms are anything but
arbitrary.

</blockquote>

<p>Where the figure 8.1 referred to above looks like this:

<pre>
    light-warm ---> white ---> white ---> white  ---> white
               \
                \-> warm  ---> warm  ---> red    ---> red
                                    \
                                     \--> yellow ---> yellow

    dark-cool  ---> dark- ---> black ---> black  ---> black
                    cool  \
                           \-> cool  ---> cool   ---> green
                                                \
                                                 \--> blue

   (2 Terms)       (3 Terms)  (4 Terms)  (5 Terms)   (6 Terms)
</pre>

<p>(I should add that in class Feldman said that this progression of
colors was not completely deterministic: there are two paths through
the space of color sophistication [<span class="cite">Feldman,
c. 2006</span>].  Canonicality of algorithm has limits; the main point
still holds.)

<p>Perhaps musical sophistication of a culture proceeds similarly:<ol>

<li> Linear Scale, because it is easy to carve flutes that way?

<li> (Circle of Fifths) Pentatonic Scale, so you have some Fifths to
play with and you notice that Fifths sound good (any scale having 5
notes is "pentatonic", so we mean the one made by four Fifths linked
together).

<li> Major (Diatonic) Scale, so you can get more overtones such as the
Third.

<li> Equally-Tempered Scale, so you can do arbitrary key changes.

</ol>

<h2 id=sec_4_3_0>4.3&nbsp; But You Can Make a Piece of Music Based Entirely on That Utterly Un-Harmonic Interval, the Augmented Fourth!</h2>

<p> Recall the diagram of the three interlocking Major Triads laid out
all in one Octave with C as the fundamental.  There is a huge gap
between F and G, which in the Major Scale we fill in with a black note
F#/Gb.  That results in an interval between C and F# called the
"Augmented Fourth" (or "Diminished Fifth"), as it is the Fourth, F,
plus a semi-tone (or the Fifth, G, minus a semi-tone).

<p>Play C and F# on a piano; it sounds awful.  This interval is also
called the Tritone as the distance between C and F# is three whole
tones (where here "tone" means a distance of two semi-tones, so a
distance of six semi-tones).  We can see how it emerges that it sounds
so bad: the ratio between F# and C it isn't near that of any of the
harmonics in the Harmonic Series.  This interval deserves its nickname
as the Devil's Interval.

<p> I have heard the following argument from a music student: all
music must be culturally-relative (as opposed to the universal,
physics-and-computation explanation we give) because someone has even
written a piece of music based entirely in the most un-harmonic of
intervals, the Augmented Fourth, and gotten away with it.

<p>There are people who can abuse themselves to the point of
re-calibrating their expectations to all kinds of strange inputs,
including thinking that getting beaten with whips is fun or that
McDonald's tastes good. That doesn't mean that those inputs are
natural or good or beautiful or true. Ben Franklin pointed this out in
a letter to Lord Kames, June 2, 1765 [<a
href="http://franklinpapers.org/">Franklin</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>[T]he Pleasure Artists feel in hearing much of that compos'd in the
modern Taste, is not the natural Pleasure arising from Melody or
Harmony of Sounds, but of the same kind with the Pleasure we feel on
seeing the surprizing Feats of Tumblers and Rope Dancers, who execute
difficult Things. For my part, I take this to be really the Case and
suppose it the Reason why those who being unpractis'd in Music, and
therefore unacquainted with those Difficulties, have little or no
Pleasure in hearing this Music. Many Pieces of it are mere
Compositions of Tricks. I have sometimes at a Concert attended by a
common Audience plac'd myself so as to see all their Faces, and
observ'd no Signs of Pleasure in them during the Performance of much
that was admir'd by the Performers themselves; while a plain old
Scottish Tune, which they disdain'd and could scarcely be prevail'd on
to play, gave manifest and general Delight.

<h2 id=sec_4_4_0>4.4&nbsp; But I've Been a Musician All My Life / Studied Music In College and I've Never Heard Any of This Before!</h2>

<p>Michael O'Donnell again [<span class="cite">O'Donnell, 14 January
2009</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>I think that most "Music Theory" as taught in music departments is
intended more as a development of descriptive terminology and notation
than as an explanatory theory. I think that a lot of humanists don't
understand the difference between description and explanation.

</blockquote>

<p>Amen to that.  But what makes me angry is that music teachers do
not even MENTION that there is a whole science of the perception of
sound and if you would like to know how it really works, then you
should talk to them.  They basically lie by omission, which is how it
ended up taking me several decades to figure all of this out.

<p>Recent music theory textbooks continue to be utterly exemplary in
the physical science and yet fall on their face completely when it
comes to the computational nature of the brain. Catherine
Schmidt-Jones [<a
href="http://cnx.org/content/col10363/1.3/">Schmidt-music-theory</a>]
again:

<blockquote>

<p>Why are some note combinations consonant and some dissonant?
Preferences for certain sounds is partly cultural; that's one of the
reasons why the traditional musics of various cultures can sound so
different from each other. Even within the tradition of Western music,
opinions about what is unpleasantly dissonant have changed a great
deal over the centuries. But consonance and dissonance do also have a
strong physical basis in nature.

<p>In simplest terms, the sound waves of consonant notes "fit" together
much better than the sound waves of dissonant notes. For example, if
two notes are an octave apart, there will be exactly two waves of one
note for every one wave of the other note. If there are two and a
tenth waves or eleven twelfths of a wave of one note for every wave of
another note, they don't fit together as well. For much more about the
physical basis of consonance and dissonance, see Acoustics for Music
Theory, Harmonic Series, and Tuning Systems.

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. There are way too many asymmetric phenomena left unexplained
by this overly-simplified theory of just whole numbers dividing each
other, two major ones being (1) the feeling that the Suspended Chord
should "resolve" to the Major Triad, and (2) the difference in the
feeling of Major and Minor Triads.  See <a href='#sec_5_1_0'>Section 5.1</a> "Helmholtz's Theory Relies Only On Interfering Overtones, But Harmony Is Something More"
for more details.


<hr><br/>
<h1 id=sec_5_0_0>5&nbsp; Helmholtz Fails to Explain Harmony</h1>

<p>After writing the first version of this article I read "This is
Your Brain on Music" by Daniel J. Levitin [<a
href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">Levitin2006</a>] and met him
when he spoke on his book at Black Oak Books in Berkeley.  I said
"I've derived the Major Scale from first principles!"  He replied in
that knowing academic manner of a professor speaking to a crackpot
[<span class="cite">Levitin, November 2006</span>]: "Oh, it's been
done by (19th-century German Physicist Hermann) Helmholtz."  I said
"would you be willing to read my article on it?"  "No," he replied.
(At least he signed my copy of the book.)

<p>Indeed, Helmholtz's theory of harmony, detailed in his treatise on
the subject "On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for
the Theory of Music" [<span class="cite">Helmholtz1863</span>], seems
to be the prevailing view of anyone I have spoken to about the
question "how does harmony work?".  I therefore feel obligated to
attempt to refute it.  The theory of Helmholtz, while making correct
observations, and while qualifying as scientific, fails to actually
explain the observed phenomena; Helmholtz isn't really wrong, he just
fails to be really right.  We enumerate several examples of this fact
below.

<p>Note that I only attempt to refute Helmholtz's theory of harmony of
<em>one</em> chord.  Given the Major and Minor Triads, Helmholtz seems
to give the same theory of a key as interlocking chords [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 300</span>] as we do above, though I
thought of it independently.

<h3 id=sec_5_0_1>5.0.1&nbsp; Overview of the Theory of Helmholtz</h3>

<p>We need yet another acoustical phenomenon in order to introduce
Helmholtz's theory, called "beating" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)">beat</a>]:

<blockquote>

[A] beat is an interference between two sounds of slightly different
frequencies, perceived as periodic variations in volume whose rate is
the difference between the two frequencies.... Beating can also be
heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a harmonic
interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a
harmonic of the second note.

</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell from studying Helmholtz's treatise, his theory
is the following.<ul>

<li>Notes have overtones, or, as Helmholtz calls them, "upper partial
tones".  (Indeed the word "overtone" in English seems to come from a
mis-translation of what Helmholtz intended to call "upper tone" in
German.)  Helmholtz also points out the phenomenon of beating.

<li>Intervals of notes are dissonant (sound bad) due to (1) beating of
(2) their overtones.  This seems to be the case when the ratio of
their frequencies are not a ratio of small whole numbers; for more,
see the extensive quote in <a href='#sec_5_3_0'>Section 5.3</a> "Helmholtz's Theory is that Pleasure is Only the Absence of Pain" where Helmholtz enumerates
intervals by increasing dissonance.

<li>Intervals are consonant (sound good) if their notes are not
dissonant.  Further, chords are consonant if the intervals of their
notes are pairwise consonant.

</ul>

<h3 id=sec_5_0_2>5.0.2&nbsp; The Theory of Helmholtz Implies that Harmony Should Not Exist as a Phenomenon of Music <em>At All</em></h3>

<p>Our primary objection to the theory of Helmholtz is so simple that
I am amazed that I seem to be the first to say it.  The failure of the
theory of Helmholtz as an explanation for harmony is made starkly
clear by a simple observation that has somehow heretofore gone
unacknowledged: his theory says that notes are in "concord" because
the sound playing them together is "less worse" than the playing
together of notes that are in less concord; but this theory is only
<em>subtractive</em>, that is, additional notes can only penalize,
some merely less than others, and so the most harmonious sound should
be a single note by itself(!) and harmony would not exist as a
phenomenon of music <em>at all</em>.  Yet harmony does exist, and does
so because people experience harmony as <em>adding</em> something
beyond the playing of a single note.

<p>Note that there is a bit of a difficulty in refuting Helmholtz: the
theory so misses the point that it is rather hard to do.  If someone
makes an argument with a small error, one can point out where he left
the path of sense: it is a <em>local</em> error which shows up clearly
against a background of otherwise correct reasoning.  On the other
hand, if someone is <em>completely</em> off, pointing out their error
is much harder.  I am reminded of the Mad Hatter's question "Why is a
raven like a writing desk?" (from "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis
Carroll [<span class="cite">Carroll1865</span>]).  A raven is not like
a writing desk, and so much not so that it is a little hard to say
<em>exactly</em> how it is not.  I shall attempt it anyway.

<h3 id=sec_5_0_3>5.0.3&nbsp; Helmholtz did not have Access to Computer Science</h3>

<p>I want to point out how it is possible that someone as intelligent
and scientifically trained as Helmholtz could produce a theory that
just misses the point on harmony.  The problem is that he was only a
physical scientist.  Physical science is a tremendous breakthrough for
human beings and physical scientists know this; many questions that
for millennia were the subject of superstition and wild speculation
were finally clarified, and in a way that could be verified on the
anvil of experiment.  This lead not just to new understanding, but new
engineering, and from this we have built a wholly new world.  It is a
triumph that can hardly be overstated.

<p>However, such success can induce arrogance and therefore blindness.
Computation science is the next breakthrough, its wave washing over us
even now.  The science of complexity and emergent behavior, "Computer
Science" if you will, is Science 2.0 and its insights again bring new
light to heretofore mysterious questions.  Physical scientists say
that Computer Science is not a science, but they are wrong:
computation/algorithm is a phenomenon of nature that surrounds us and
has stable, though often mysterious, properties that can be reliably
verified by experiment.  It is a tradition in Music Theory to resort
only to physics for the explanations; however this is a mistake, as
using only physical science ignores<ul>

  <li>the computational nature of the brain,

  <li>how much we really do know about the canonicality of the space
of algorithm itself,

  <li>and how much the brain must be using the canonical algorithms to
solve the very difficult problem of surviving and thriving in everyday
life using very constrained resources.

</ul>

It is only because of this new computational understanding that this
article before you can even be written.

<h2 id=sec_5_1_0>5.1&nbsp; Helmholtz's Theory Relies Only On Interfering Overtones, But Harmony Is Something More</h2>

<p>"On the Sensations of Tone" by Hermann Helmholtz [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 211</span>] (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>The first problem is to determine <em>under what conditions chords
are consonant</em>, in which case they are termed <em>concords</em>.
It is quite clear that the first condition of a concord is that each
tone of it should form a consonance with each of the other tones ; for
if any two tones formed a dissonance, beats would arise destroying the
tunefulness of the chord.  Concords of three tones are readily found
by taking two consonant intervals to any one fundamental tone as
<em>c</em>, and then seeing whether the new third interval between the
two new tones, which is thus produced, is also consonant.  If this is
the case each one of the three tones forms a consonant interval with
each one of the other two, and the chord is consonant, or is a
concord.

</blockquote>

<p>Now compare to this passage from the "Auditory Demonstrations" CD
[<span class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 31</span>], "Tones and
Tuning with Stretched Partials" (underlining added):

<blockquote>

<p>Most tonal musical instruments used in Western culture have spectra
that are exactly or nearly harmonic.  Tone scales used in Western
music are also based on intervals or frequency ratios of simple
integers, such as the octave (2:1), the fifth (3:2), and the major
third (5:4).  When several instruments play a consonant chord such as
a major triad (do-mi-so), harmonics will match so that no beats will
occur.  If one changes the melodic scale to, for instance, a scale of
equal temperament with 13 tones in an octave, harmonics will have
nearly but not exactly the same frequency.  Similarly, instruments
with a nonharmonic overtone structures, such as conventional carillon
bells, can create unpleasant beat sensations even if their pitches are
tuned to a natural scale.  Beats will not occur, however, if the
melodic scale of an instrument's tones matches the overtone structures
of those tones.

<p>First, a four-part chorale ("Als der gütige Gott") by J.S. Bach is
played on a synthesized piano-like instrument whose tones have 9
exactly harmonic partials with amplitudes inversely proportional to
harmonic number, and with exponential time decay.  The melodic scale
used is equally tempered, with semitone frequency ratios of
<sup>12</sup>&radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">2</span>
[the twelfth root of 2].

<p>In the second example, the same piece is played with equally
stretched harmonic as well as melodic frequency ratios.  The harmonics
of each tone have been uniformly stretched on a log-frequency scale
such that the second harmonic is 2.1 times the fundamental frequency,
the 4th harmonic 4.41 times the fundamental, etc.  The melodic scale
is similarly tuned in such a way that each "semitone" step represents
a frequency ratio of <sup>12</sup>&radic;<span style="text-decoration:
overline;">2.1</span> [the twelfth root of 2.1].  The music is, in a
sense not dissonant because no beats occur.  Nevertheless the
harmonies may sound less consonant than the did in the first
demonstration.  <span class="emph">This suggests that the presence or
absence of beats is not the only criterion for consonance.</span> The
listener may also find it difficult to tell how many voices or parts
the chorale has, since notes seem to have lost their gestalt due to
the inharmonicity of their partials.

<p>In the third example, the tones are made exactly harmonic again,
but the melodic scale remains stretched to an "octave" ratio of 2.1.
Disturbing beats are heard, but the four voices have regained their
gestalt.  The piece sounds as if it is played on an out-of-tune
instrument.

<p>In the final example, the harmonics of all tones are stretched, as
was done in example 2, but the melodic scale is one of equal
temperament based on an octave ratio of 2.0.  Again there are annoying
beats.  This time, however, it is again very difficult to hear how
many voices the chorale has.

</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the above Demo 31 tests Helmholtz's assertion that
what makes two notes consonant is that when played together the two
overtone series "fit" into one another, rather than being off and
making "beats".  Their test works like this: using a computer we can
make an artificial piano-like instrument that has any properties we
want, including those the laws of physics would prohibit, such as
making an overtone series that is stretched out.  That is, the
overtones are not in the Harmonic Series having the ratios 1, 2, 3, 4,
5... but from in a series of those numbers but then multiplied by a
constant; here the constant makes an octave a factor of 2.1 instead of
the usual factor of 2.  (I am thinking therefore that the constant
must be 2.1 / 2 = 1.05).  In the test, they vary two variables
independently: (a) <em>harmonics</em> (overtones of the notes played):
normal overtone series versus stretched, and (b) <em>melodics</em>
(fundamental tones of the notes played): normal scale versus stretched
scale.  They play the same piece in four combinations. <ol>

  <li>harmonics normal, melodics normal,
  <li>harmonics stretched, melodics stretched,
  <li>harmonics normal, melodics stretched,
  <li>harmonics stretched, melodics normal.

</ol>

<p>If Helmholtz were right about harmony, then it seems that part 2
(both harmonics and melodics stretched the same) would sound just as
good as part 1 (normal). However the commentator points out that this
is simply not the case. The commentator further points out in the
underlined sentence that this is bad news for the accepted theory of
Helmholtz: "This suggests that the presence or absence of beats is not
the only criterion for consonance."  That is: (a) Helmholtz is right
that harmonies minimize beats, and (b) if we stretch both the harmony
and the melody the same amount, we do not get beats, but (c) we have
also lost some harmony, so something else must be going on to create
harmony.

<p>That said, note that we are claiming that the theory of Helmholtz
is incomplete, not that it is completely wrong: it seems that
overtones interfering with each other likely do matter, as suggested
by the observation on beats in the quoted text of Demo 31 above.  If
they did not, then our theory of pure vertical intervals from <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes" would imply that part 4 of Demo 31
would sound as good as part 1; however, as the commentator points out,
it does not.  Note that, in particular, it does not sound good due to
beats (again, according to the commentator), which seems to be what
Helmholtz would suggest.  Below, Terhardt [<span
class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>] also agrees with this point that
the absence of beats/roughness does not cause consonance, however the
presence of beats/roughness does cause dissonance; see <a href='#sec_6_1_0'>Section 6.1</a> "Terhardt Recognizes that the Brain is Listening For Something".
Therefore, again, the theory of Helmholtz isn't really <em>wrong</em>;
it is however <em>incomplete</em>, and rather strikingly so.  See
<a href='#sec_2_3_3'>Section 2.3.3</a> "Vertical Intervals Have Pure Ratios" for more discussion on
this point.

<h2 id=sec_5_2_0>5.2&nbsp; Helmholtz's Theory Does Not Imply Virtual Pitch</h2>

<p>A secondary feature of Demo 31 above is that in exactly those cases
where the harmonics are stretched, the commentator says the notes
"loose their gestalt", suggesting very strongly that the brain is
hard-wired to listen for the (normal) Harmonic Series as we discussed
in <a href='#sec_2_1_1'>Section 2.1.1</a> "Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There".

<p>We can already see here that Helmholtz's analysis is in
contradiction to our theory: he sees the "tunefulness" of a chord as
being <em>reductionistic</em>, or no more than the sum of the parts,
whereas our theory is <em>holistic</em>, that the brain is listening
to the whole chord which is somehow more than just the sum of the
parts.  The theory of Helmholtz has no way of explaining Virtual Pitch
nor the phenomenon observed by musicians that one may <em>omit the
Root of the chord(!)</em> and the listener will <em>still hear the
chord</em> which we discuss and explain <a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity".

<p>Such a phenomenon can only be explained by the brain listening for
<em>whole</em> chords (as abstracted Harmonic Series-es). Helmholtz's
theory that notes sound good together because, well, in combination
they weren't so terribly dissonant, proposes no mechanism whatsoever
for a tone/note being <em>added</em> because it was found to be
missing.

<h2 id=sec_5_3_0>5.3&nbsp; Helmholtz's Theory is that Pleasure is Only the Absence of Pain</h2>

<p>But what is Helmholtz's definition of these consonant intervals
that are so important to his theory? From [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 181</span>] (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>Two musical tones, therefore, which stand in the relation of a
perfect Octave [2/1], a perfect Twelfth [3/1], or a perfect Fifth
[3/2], go on sounding uniformly without disturbance, and are thus
distinguished from the next adjacent intervals, imperfect Octaves and
Fifths, of which a part of the tone breaks up into distinct pulses,
and consequently the two tones do not continue to sound without
interruption. For this reason the perfect Octave, Twelfth, and Fifth
will be called <em>consonant intervals</em> in contradistinction to
the next adjacent intervals, which are termed <em>dissonant</em>.
Although these names were given long ago, long before anything was
known about upper partial tones and their beats, they give a very
correct notion of the essential character of the phenomenon which
consist in the undisturbed or disturbed coexistence of sounds.

</blockquote>

<p>Well, there isn't much science here other than the proclamation
that certain ratios are consonant because everybody says so. But
notice below that we are to accept on faith that an interval having a
ratio 3/2 is consonant, but an interval having a ratio of, say, 4/3 is
not quite consonant; I suppose Helmholtz simply considers this to be
an empirical observation. For completeness I have included his entire
taxonomy of intervals and their qualities. From [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 194</span>] (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>When two musical tones are sounded at the same time, their united
sound is generally disturbed by the beats of the upper partials, so
that a greater or less part of the whole mass of sound is broken up
into pulses of tone, and the joint effect is rough. This relation is
called <em>Dissonance</em>.

<p>But there are certain determinate ratios between pitch numbers, for
which this rule suffers an exception, and either no beats at all are
formed, or at least only such as have so little intensity that they
produce no unpleasant disturbance of the united sound.  These
exceptional cases are called <em>Consonances</em>.

<p>1. The most perfect <em>consonances</em> are those that have been
here called <em>absolute</em>, in which the prime tone of one of the
combined notes coincides with some partial tone of the other.  To this
group belong the <em>Octave</em>, <em>Twelfth</em>, and <em>double
Octave</em>.

<p>2. Next follow the <em>Fifth</em> and the <em>Fourth</em>, which
may be called <em>perfect consonances</em>, because they may be used
in all parts of the scale without any important disturbance of
harmoniousness.  The Fourth is the less perfect consonance and
approaches those of the next group.  It owes its superiority in
musical practice simply to its being the defect of a Fifth from an
Octave, a circumstance to which we shall return in a later chapter.

<p>3. The next group consists of the <em>major Sixth</em> and the
<em>major Third</em>, which may be called <em>medial consonances</em>.
The old writers on harmony considered them as imperfect consonances.
In lower parts of the scale the disturbance of the harmoniousness is
very sensible, but in the higher positions it disappears, because the
beats are too rapid to be sensible.  But each, in good musical
qualities of tone, is independently characterized, by the fact that
any little defect in its intonation produces sensible beats of the
upper partials, and consequently each interval is sharply separated
form all adjacent intervals.

<p>4. The <em>imperfect consonances</em>, consisting of the <em>minor
Third</em> and the <em>minor Sixth</em>, are not in general
independently characterized, because in good musical qualities of tone
the partial on which their definition depend are often not found for
the minor Third, and are generally absent of the minor Sixth, so that
small imperfections in the intonation of these intervals do not
necessarily produce beats.

</blockquote>

<h3 id=sec_5_3_1>5.3.1&nbsp; Harmony is Rapture</h3>

<p>Helmholtz defines the <em>pleasure</em> of a chord as the absence
of the <em>pain</em> of the beats of the overtones.  However, pleasure
is not simply the absence of pain, or otherwise we should prefer
silence to any music at all.  Sometimes we enjoy silence, but
sometimes we really enjoy music.

<p>Further, I and many others experience an intense joy at the sound
of harmony, especially vocal harmony; see <a href='#sec_2_3_6'>Section 2.3.6</a> "Harmony is Sweeter Than Sweet" above.  If this joy were merely the absence of the pain of
dissonance, how is it that I not simply prefer the sound of once one
single voice?  Here is a song that describes the feeling well,
"Harmony" [<span class="cite">Grammer-harmony</span>]:

<blockquote>

Singin' Har-ar-ar...mony.<br>
One voice makes me want to sing,<br>
Two voices make me feel like a king,<br>
Three voices gettin' out of hand,<br>
Four like to take me to the promised land.<br>
Singin' Har-ar-ar...mony,<br>

</blockquote>

<p>These lyrics describing the power of harmony are not mere fanciful
imagination.  When I sang in the Men's Barbershop group Cable Car
Chorus I had I similar experience: harmony wasn't just nice and
lacking in pain, it was rapture.  Once I was being given a ride back
to town from practice with one of the senior members Charles Feltman
(now director) and the then-director Bill Ganz.  I was searching for a
word to describe the unique feeling of singing four-part harmony.
After a while I said the feeling was "visceral".  They both
immediately exclaimed that that was the same word that they themselves
had eventually converged upon after a similar deliberation [<span
class="cite">Feltman, Ganz, c. mid 1990s</span>] .  Harmony is a
uniquely powerful force for people.  The mere lack of a few
interfering upper harmonics can't possibly produce from
<em>absence</em> of annoyance such a powerful <em>presence</em> of
visceral rapture.

<h2 id=sec_5_4_0>5.4&nbsp; Helmholtz's Theory Fails to Fully Explain the Qualitative Difference Between the Major and Minor Triads</h2>

<p>People experience the Minor Triad as sounding quite different from
the Major Triad. Yet Helmholtz's primary theory, namely that the
"tunefulness" of a chord is a function of the consonance and
dissonance of the intervals induced by the chord, has problems here:
as we saw above, the Major and Minor Triads induce the <em>exact same
three intervals</em> (in a different order)! Can he rescue himself by
finding some other difference between them? From [<span
class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 189</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>The precedence given to the Fourth over the major Sixth and major
Third, is rather due to its being the inversion of the Fifth than to
its own inherent harmoniousness.

</blockquote>

<p>Wow is that strange.  He speaks as if there are two ways of hearing
the Fourth: hearing its "inherent" harmoniousness, and then hearing it
as an inversion of the Fifth.  Yet, his theory <em>gives no
explanation at all as to how an interval that is an inverted form of
another (and shifted down an Octave) should be heard as the same
interval or as a related interval to the original</em>: his whole
theory is the interference of partials, which as far as I can tell
allows for no notion of recognizing one interval as an inversion of
another.  (He speaks more of inversions on p. 213, but with no more
justification.)

<p>From a section with the heading (perhaps given by the translator?)
"Ambiguity of the Minor Chord", [<span class="cite">Helmholtz1863,
p. 294</span>] (note that here the square brackets are in the
original):

<blockquote>

<p>In the minor chord c - e'b + g, the g is a constituent of the
compound tones of both c and e'b. Neither e'b nor c occurs in either
of the other two compound tones c, g. Hence it is clear that g at
least is a dependent tone. But, on the other hand, this minor chord
can be regarded either as a compound tone of c with an added e'b or as
a compound tone of e'b with an added c. Both views are entertained at
different times, but the fist usually prevails. If we regard the chord
as the compound tone of c, we find g for its third partial, while the
foreign tone e'b only occupies the place of the weak fifth partial e1.
But if we regarded the chord as a compound tone of e'b, although the
weak fifth partial g would be properly represented, the stronger third
partial, which ought to be b'b, is replaced by the foreign tone c.
Hence in modern music we usually find the minor chord c - e'b + g
treated as if its root or fundamental bass were c, so that the chord
appears as somewhat altered and obscured compound tone of c. But the
cord also occurs in the position e'b + g ... c (or better still as e'b
+ g ... c') even in the key of B'b major, as a substitute for the
chord of the subdominant e'b. Rameau then calls it the chord of the
great Sixth [in English 'added Sixth'], and, more correctly than most
modern theoreticians, regards e'b as its fundamental bass.

</blockquote>

<p>He notices that the Minor Triad contains different parts of
different Harmonic Series-es, but doesn't fit into any of them.

<blockquote><em>Helmholtz's explanation of the Minor Triad is quite
complex and odd for a phenomenon so frequently used and fundamental to
music as the Minor Triad.  The explanation of Helmholtz makes the
Minor sound like some abortive thing that we could just as easily
throw out, whereas in music the Major and Minor are treated as a kind
of duals of almost equal status.  We assert that clear and simple
phenomena such as this should have clear and simple
explanations.</em></blockquote>

<p>Further, he concludes by justifying the Minor Third as really being
an Added Sixth when a different note is taken as the Root (or
"fundamental bass") of the chord.  But as we saw above, according to
Helmholtz the (Major) Sixth is considered to be a rather dissonant
interval.  So for what purpose use it at all?

<p>Further, I suspect that he really cannot be right about Eb being
the real Root of a Cm (C Minor) chord, because otherwise it would make
no sense to build Minor chords with higher harmonics unless all of
those higher harmonics were also named wrong and also by coincidence
made another chord. For example, the Cm9 (C Minor ninth) chord would
not make any sense as a ninth chord if C was not really the Root of
the chord. If indeed Eb is the Root of Cm9, then the chord is really
EbMaj7(add6) or Eb6(add Maj7); I suppose that could be the case but it
sounds awfully ad-hoc to me. (Similarly Cm7 becomes Eb6.) Try voicing
them that way (putting the higher harmonics in higher Octaves) and see
how it sounds. From [<span class="cite">Helmholtz1863, p. 300</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>Minor chords do not represent the compound tone of their root as
well as the major chords : their Third, indeed, does not form any part
of this compound tone.  The dominant chord alone is major, and it
contains the two supplementary tones of the scale.  Hence when these
appear as constituents of the dominant triad, and therefore of the
compound tone of the dominant, they are connected with the tonic by
the close relationship of Fifths.  On the other hand, the tonic and
subdominant triads do not simply represent the compound tones of the
tonic and subdominant notes, but are accompanied by Thirds which
cannot be reduced to the close relationship of Fifths.  The tones of
the Minor Scale can therefore not be harmonized in such a way as to
link them with the tonic note by so close a relationship as in the
major mode.

</blockquote>

<p>So Helmholtz does seem to notice that (1) all notes in the Major
Triad have a ratio to the Root that is in the Harmonic Series whereas
(2) this is not the case for the Minor Triad.  Further, on p. 212
Helmholtz tries all combinations of triads consisting of two intervals
already "known" to be consonant with the Root, and notices that the
only ones which induce a third interval that is on his list of
intervals known to be consonant with each other are the Major and
Minor Triads.

<p>He almost gets to the truth: (1) he notices that the Minor Triad
also has the same three intervals as the Major Triad and (2) that the
Major Triad "represents the compound tone of their root" better than
the Minor.  Yet he never seems to put these two facts together into a
coherent theory that the brain is listening for the <em>presence</em>
of something, namely an abstracted version of the overtone series of
common sound-making devices (tubes and strings, and in particular,
voice) called the ideal Harmonic Series, rather than just an
<em>absence</em> of colliding "upper partials".  That is, at best his
theory explains how it is that Major sounds better than Minor, but it
fails to explain (a) how Major sounds so compelling and "right", even
when inverted, (b) how Minor sounds like something other than noise,
like something I recognize, and yet simultaneously like something that
is off or has something missing about it, and (c) how it is that it
might make sense that Major and Minor are afforded a kind of almost
equal dual status in music when his explanation for Minor is so
convoluted and odd.<ul>

  <li>"Major" isn't just a combinatorial accident minimizing pain as
Helmholtz would have us believe, instead it is <em>positively
recognized as something</em>.

  <li>"Minor" isn't just a more dissonant other combinatorial
accident, instead it is <em>both positively recognized and yet
not-right at the same time</em>.

  </ul>

<h2 id=sec_5_5_0>5.5&nbsp; Helmholtz Isn't Really Wrong, He Just Fails To Be Really Right</h2>
  
<p>I still feel as if I am trying to explain the difference between a
raven and a writing desk: Helmholtz wanders around for pages and pages
with high verbosity computing ratios of notes.  He then fails to come
to some coherent theory that really is more than intervals not of low
whole number ratios sound bad because they make overtones that make
beats.  While beats do sound bad, he takes his theory too far,
attempting to use it to explain compelling phenomena that it just does
not explain. <ol>

<li>Helmholtz explains the pleasure of harmony as the <em>absence</em>
of pain, however it is clearly more, a <em>presence</em> of something.
Helmholtz does not explain virtual pitch or the related phenomenon
that chords can be played with the Root or even the Fifth omitted.  We
explain it simply in <a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity": the brain
wants to hear the Harmonic Series.

<li>As far as I know Helmholtz has no explanation for why the
Suspended chord "wants" to resolve to the Major Triad.  Again, we
explain it simply in <a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity": the brain
wants to hear <em>one</em> Harmonic Series.

<li>Helmholtz almost seems to hit upon the idea that the Minor Triad
has the ratios of the Harmonic Series that occur in the Major Triad,
but he really just notices that both triads induce three intervals
with low whole number ratios.  Further he remarks that the Minor Triad
can be thought of with different notes as the Root, making the Minor
Third into the Major Sixth, but he doesn't say for what purpose we
should care about this interval <em>at all</em>, having also said the
Major Sixth is rather dissonant anyway.  His theory has no explanation
for how it is that this very odd thing called the Minor Triad seems to
have about equal status with the Major Triad in idiomatic musical
usage.  We explain it simply: the compellingness of <em>both</em>
Major and Minor comes from the Harmonic Series with the Minor
functioning as a kind of Auditory Cubism; see <a href='#sec_3_4_2'>Section 3.4.2</a> "The Minor as Auditory Cubism".

</ol>

<p>Helmholtz never seems to be wrong, he just never <em>finishes the
job</em>: his theory just stops before explaining the observed
phenomena.  We can measure the ratios of the height and width of two
cars but it won't explain how they got into a crash.  Helmholtz just
fails to provide a simple and compelling explanation of harmony.
There's nothing wrong with that -- future generations will find errors
and omissions in our work as well -- thus is the nature of progress.
That said however:

<blockquote><em>People should not be lulled into thinking that they
have an answer when they do not -- that they have a full understanding
of harmony when they do not.</em></blockquote>


<hr><br/>
<h1 id=sec_6_0_0>6&nbsp; Other Modern Theories, such as Terhardt and 'Fusion or pattern matching' Theory</h1>

<p>After deriving this whole theory I found some competing theories of
consonance and dissonance to the theory of Helmholtz which I felt
obligated to investigate.

From [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor">maj-min</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>Advanced theory

<p>[diagram] Minor as upside down major.

<p>[diagram] Major and minor triads: The minor mode is considered the
inverse of the major mode.

<p>In the German theory by or derived from Hugo Riemann, the minor
mode is considered the inverse of the major mode, an upside down major
scale based on (theoretical) undertones rather than (actual) overtones
(harmonics) (See also: Utonality). The "root" of the minor triad is
thus considered the top of the fifth, which, in the United States, is
called "the" fifth. So in C minor, the tonic root is actually G, and
the leading tone is Ab (a halfstep), rather than, in major, the root
being C and the leading tone B (a halfstep).

</blockquote>

<p>This theory of undertones would be a great explanation of the Minor
Triad if <em>in reality there actually were undertones</em>!  (People
seem to be able to produce them in rather artificial circumstances
which you never experience in daily life and which therefore make no
sense as an explanation: [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertone_series">undertone</a>])
Or if someone could demonstrate some computational process in the
brain result resulting in an artifact of undertones, say, due to the
exploitation of some symmetry as an optimization (similar to the way
we conjecture Octaves to be an artifact resulting from an
optimization) then there might be something here.  However I see no
optimization in the processing of (normal, everyday) sound that would
require reversing the low-high order of tones.

One reader wrote me who was so enamored of undertones that I have had
to elaborate on their non-existence, so I thought I would include that
discussion in case others need it.  I found that the problem in
explaining this is that undertones <em>look</em> reasonable if you
spend too much time staring at a piano keyboard: they are just like
overtones, but in the other direction!  However note that the keyboard
is a <em>visual metaphor</em> for an <em>auditory reality</em>.  While
many phenomena are visually left-right symmetric, in nature overtones
go up and not down.  That is, there is a fundamental directional
asymmetry in higher and lower tones; however there are many things
that exhibit left-to-right visual symmetry and our brain is structured
for that; thus by thinking of tones visually we are fooled into seeing
(literally) an auditory symmetry that does not exist.  Maybe if they
keyboard went up and down instead we wouldn't have this problem as
fewer phenomena are visually up-down symmetric.

Again, the fact that the minor triad is the major triad "upside down"
is completely lost on the brain and is only something you can see
visually on the keyboard.  When we present the notes on the piano
keyboard in a left-to-right manner then the ability of our
<em>visual</em> system to flip things left to right kicks in, because
left to right visual symmetry is very frequent in this world.

However there is <em>NO</em> reason whatsoever for the brain to have
an ability to compute the reciprocal of a note frequency or frequency
pair.  Unlike visual left-right symmetry, such sonic upside-down
symmetry <em>never</em> occurs in nature and so there is no reason
whatsoever to suppose a mechanism for recognizing it, just as animals
that don't eat fruit cannot perceive sweetness: there's no point in
doing so.

Again, "undertones" are a fantasy induced by falling for your own
metaphor.  All of this "upside down" and "undertones" etc. is a red
herring induced by your looking at the piano keyboard for too long.
Instead, look at the fundamentals of the harmonic series (physics) and
of recognizer algorithms (computation) and all will become clear.

<p>From [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance">con-dis</a>]:

<blockquote>

<p>Fusion or pattern matching: fundamentals may be perceived through
pattern matching of the separately analyzed partials to a best-fit
exact-harmonic template (Gerson & Goldstein, 1978) or the best-fit
subharmonic (Terhardt, 1974), or harmonics may be perceptually fused
into one entity, with dissonances being those intervals less likely to
be mistaken for unisons, the imperfect intervals, because of the
multiple estimates, at perfect intervals, of fundamentals, for one
harmonic tone (Terhardt, 1974). By these definitions, inharmonic
partials of otherwise harmonic spectra are usually processed
separately (Hartmann et al., 1990), unless frequency or amplitude
modulated coherently with the harmonic partials (McAdams, 1983). For
some of these definitions, neural firing supplies the data for pattern
matching; see directly below (e.g., Moore, 1989; pp. 183–187;
Srulovicz & Goldstein, 1983).

<p>Period length or neural-firing coincidence: with the length of
periodic neural firing created by two or more waveforms, higher simple
numbers creating longer periods or lesser coincidence of neural firing
and thus dissonance (Patternson, 1986; Boomsliter & Creel, 1961;
Meyer, 1898; Roederer, 1973, pp. 145-149). Purely harmonic tones cause
neural firing exactly with the period or some multiple of the pure
tone.

</blockquote>

<p>The "Period length or neural-firing coincidence" theory seems easy
to dispose of: how should it work that coincidental firing of
different tones should be something the brain is looking for
particularly?  Is it just a bug in the brain that it is pleasurable
when the periods of neural firings line up?  There is no motivation.

<p>However the "Fusion or pattern matching" theory seems much more
interesting, so we will investigate it further.

<h2 id=sec_6_1_0>6.1&nbsp; Terhardt Recognizes that the Brain is Listening For Something</h2>

<p>I was unable to locate a copy of Terhardt, E. (1974) "On the
perception of periodic sound fluctuations (roughness)" Acustica 30
(4): 201–213, however I did locate Terhardt "Pitch, consonance, and
harmony" J. Acoust Soc. Am., Vol.55, No.5, May 1974 (received 1973),
pp. 1061-1069 [<span class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>] (thanks you
helpful university librarians! see the acknowledgements).  This work
is surprisingly relevant; here is the abstract in full (emphasis in
the original):

<blockquote>

Comparison of recent psychoacoustic data on consonance with those on
roughness reveals that "psychoacoustic consonance" merely corresponds
to the absence of roughness and is only slightly and indirectly
correlated with musical intervals.  Thus, psychoacoustic consonance
cannot be considered as the basis of the sense of musical intervals.
The basis of that sense seems to be provided by the <em>concept of
virtual pitch</em>.  This concept is introduced with a model.  The
concept accounts for many psychoacoustiac and musical phenomenas[sic],
e.g., the ambiguity of pitch of complex tones, the "residue," the
pitch of inharmonic signals, the dominance of certain harmonics, pitch
shifts, the sense for musical intervals, octave periodicity, octave
enlargement, "stretching" of musical scales, and the "tonal meaning"
of chords in music.

</blockquote>

<p>His first sentence points out without naming him that the theory
Helmholtz is flawed in the sense that it does not explain everything,
just as we point out.  Then he points out that the concept of virtual
pitch has a lot of explanatory power; by virtual pitch he is implying
the same model we are: the brain is <em>looking for something</em>,
namely the Harmonic Series (which is present in speech), and that this
activity of the brain results in a phenomenon called virtual pitch;
see <a href='#sec_2_1_1'>Section 2.1.1</a> "Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There".  The main point is that hearing sound is not a physical
phenomena all the way through and at some point <em>computational
considerations take over</em>.

<p>Terhardt concludes his article with several points, the first three
of which again agree with us completely (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The concept of psychoacoustic consonance which is defined by
the absence of roughness does not provide a satisfactory explanation of
the ear's particular sense of musical intervals. On the other hand,
roughness probably <em>is</em> an important factor in music since it
has an annoying effect.  Thus one may conclude that psychoacoustic
consonance accounts for a sound's pleasantness, in a very general
sense.

<p>(2) Tonal music seems to be based on the fact that the auditory
system behaves as an active processor of <em>Gestalt</em> attributes.
By repeatedly processing <em>speech</em>, the auditory system acquires
-- among other <em>Gestalt</em> laws -- knowledge of the specific
pitch relations which exist between the lower six to eight harmonics
of complex tones.  These pitch intervals become <em>familiar</em> to
the "central processor" of the auditory system and, moreover, convey
"virtual tonal meanings," i.e. certain subharmonic bass notes.  This
way, these intervals become the so-called musical intervals.

<p>(3) The realization of musical sounds seems to be governed by the
two foregoing principles which may be termed <em>the principle of
minimal roughness</em> and <em>the principle of tonal meanings</em>.
Both principles imply certain requirements for the
fundamental-frequency ratios and spectral configurations of realized
<em>musical chords</em>.

</blockquote>

<p>Wow.  Point (1) recapitulates both of our points about the theory
of Helmholtz: (a) it is incomplete, however (b) it is correct as far
as it goes -- that is, absence of roughness does not provide
consonance, but roughness does provide dissonance.  Point (2)
recapitulates our point that the brain is listening <em>for
something</em> and that this likely derives from a
<em>computational</em> mechanism for processing speech (he even calls
the brain a "'central processor'").  Point (3) posits that chords
therefore result from <em>two</em> activities: (a) listening
<em>for</em> something ("tonal meaning") in addition to the usual (b)
<em>avoiding</em> roughness.

<p>I have not attempted to follow the computational model of the core
of his article, but the result seems to be that (a) using human speech
input to train (b) his learning model results in a machine that
exhibits the artifact of hearing the classical intervals in the usual
chords.  This theory reminds me generally of our derivation of the
same intervals by (a) assuming, as he does, that the brain is
optimized for processing speech and in particular finding the harmonic
series, and then (b) assuming a subtraction signal processing
optimization in the brain resulting in relative pitch, as we do in
<a href='#sec_2_2_1'>Section 2.2.1</a> "Relative Pitch: Differences Between Sounds".  However, how
close his learning model and our subtraction optimization (the two
part (b)-s in the preceding) are to one another I cannot say as I did
not study his model.

<p>However I do not see how he can get away without also assuming an
additional mechanism for getting rid of powers of two, as we do in
<a href='#sec_2_2_2'>Section 2.2.2</a> "Octaves: Sounds Normalized to a Factor of Two".  Terhardt
[<span class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH, section E.2</span>] claims that
a simple learning model of the brain together with inputs from speech
also induce the octave effect.  I did not follow his argument, but I
also did not try very hard.  If he is right, then the number of
mechanisms we require in the brain for our theory could possibly be
reduced by one, as we instead assumed Octaves result from an
optimization built into the brain.

<h2 id=sec_6_2_0>6.2&nbsp; Terhardt Does Not Explain Suspended and Minor Chords</h2>

virtual pitch. The visual system perceives contours which actually are
not present.']" />

<p>Terhardt [<span class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>] suggests that
the "Gestalt" perception of the whole Harmonic Series induces the
auditory illusion called virtual pitch.  He explains this by "analogy"
with the effect that the "Gestalt" perception of images may sometimes
induce visual illusions; see his figure on the right, which he quotes
from [<span class="cite">Coren1972</span>] (that is, the image on the
right is a literal screen shot of Figure 4 and its caption in [<span
class="cite">Terhardt1974-PCH</span>] which includes (1) a figure that
Terhardt seems to be quoting from [<span
class="cite">Coren1972</span>] and (2) a caption which seems to be
Terhardt remarking upon the figure he quoted from Coren; my apologies
if this is not the correct way to quote a figure of someone quoting a
figure of someone else while also quoting the quoters caption making
commentary on that quoted figure; it doesn't help that HTML doesn't
have a standard way to add a caption and that there is no good way to
put quotes around a figure).  We basically agree with Terhardt's
visual-illusion metaphor of virtual pitch; see <a href='#sec_2_1_1'>Section 2.1.1</a> "Virtual Pitch: Hearing the Harmonic Series Even When it is Not There".  Terhardt's
notion of Gestalt is a more primitive version of the feature vector
understanding that we give here in <a href='#sec_2_5_0'>Section 2.5</a> "Recognition: Feature Vectors" and the visual illusion illustrates the concomitant effect of
false recognition that we speak of in <a href='#sec_2_5_2'>Section 2.5.2</a> "False Recognition"
(though our theory was arrived at independently through use of
standard Computer Science).

<p style="clear:both">Terhardt again (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

Thus, with respect to a theory of consonance and harmony it appears
rather promising that the concept of virtual pitch readily provides
subjective cues which correspond to subharmonics of given
tones. Figure 7(h) [not shown] depicts the distribution of
virtual-pitch cues which is produced when the model is stimulated by a
<em>major triad</em> consisting of three complex tones, i.e., a
typical sound of music. The distribution has pronounced maxima one and
two octaves below the lowest one of the primary fundamentals. This
means that the system attributes to the chord I-III-V the "tonal
meaning" I. One can easily prove that the model reflects also for
other musical chords the well-known relations between fundamental
frequencies and "tonal meaning."  Hence, by means of the concept of
virtual pitch, the theory of consonance and harmony possibly can be
provided with what was lacking yet: a psychoacoustic basis.

</blockquote>

<p>In a sense, Terhardt really gets quite close to our theory, his
notion of "Gestalt" explaining the Major Triad in a manner similar to
the way we do, though without real computational sophistication: he
notices that a recognizer trained to hear the Harmonic Series will
also be fired by some chords.  However though Terhardt goes on to
claim that 'One can easily prove that the model reflects also for
other musical chords the well-known relations between fundamental
frequencies and "tonal meaning."', he never actually does it.
Terhardt never goes further to use the common computational
understanding that we have today of a feature vector detector and
computational disambiguation engine, so he does not come to our
ultimate explanations of ambiguous chords, such as the desire of the
Suspended chord to resolve to the Major Triad (see <a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity") or how the the Minor Triad can be understood as a
form of auditory cubism (see <a href='#sec_3_4_2'>Section 3.4.2</a> "The Minor as Auditory Cubism").

<p>Regarding the other work of the above "Fusion or pattern matching"
theory, "Evidence for a general template in central optimal processing
for pitch of complex tones" Gerson & Goldstein 1978 seems completely
irrelevant, but I found it quite hard to follow so I cannot be
certain.  There seems to be an article "Fusion or pattern matching:
fundamentals may be perceived through pattern matching of the
separately analyzed partials to a best-fit exact-harmonic template" by
Gerson & Goldstein 1978 that I could not locate easily and so I did
not investigate.  I also did not read any of the later references
mentioned.  The paragraph above from Wikipedia implies that articles
in this thread will be similar to Terhardt: <ul>

  <li>They support the conjecture that the brain is <em>listening for
  something</em>, likely the Harmonic series.

  <li>This observation therefore supports the conclusion that the
  brain finds the classic intervals inherently
  pleasurable/interesting.

  <li>However this observation does not take this line of explanation
  further into the computational models of feature vectors and
  disambiguation engines; we suggest that it is these models may be an
  original contribution of this work.

</ul>

<p>Perhaps I should investigate the literature further, but I am must
truncate this investigation somewhere; even UC Berkeley didn't have
entire journal(s) that I needed for some articles (I invite the reader
to subtract the start and stop dates at the top of the article).  If
anyone had come up with my theory of the Minor presented in <a href='#sec_3_4_2'>Section 3.4.2</a> "The Minor as Auditory Cubism" then Temperley [<span
class="cite">Temperley2007</span>] would likely not have still been
wondering how it is that the Minor and Major sound so different in
January 2007.

<p>However, should any of my readers find anything relevant in the
undoubtedly rich literature of prior research into acoustic models
which have computational explanatory power relevant to our question of
"how does harmony work?", please do let me know and if I publish an
updated version of this article, I will include it.

<h1 id=sec_7_0_0>7&nbsp; Future Work: Towards A Unifying Theory of Music</h1>

<p>Can this explanation of harmony be extended to a more general model
of music, including melody, rhythm, and most importantly, emotion?  We
outline some thoughts on how this might be done.

<h2 id=sec_7_1_0>7.1&nbsp; Melody as Arpeggio</h2>

Does the brain somehow "keep" notes for a period after they have
finished actually sounding? It seems likely. Therefore could notes
heard over time but not simultaneously combine to form chords?  Given
our model of the brain listening <em>for</em> the Harmonic Series, it
seems likely. Could playing some of the notes of a chord make you
"want" to hear the rest of the notes and complete the chord?  Again,
given our theory, it seems likely.  Breaking a chord apart and playing
the notes one at a time is called "arpeggio" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arp</a>].

<blockquote><strong>Conjecture Eleven</strong> (Benjamin Franklin):
Melody is arpeggio (at least partially).</blockquote>

<p>Ben has so many good insights in this letter on music and the
performance thereof that I cannot resist quoting most of it. From [<a
href="http://franklinpapers.org/">Franklin</a>] (paragraph breaks
added), to Lord Kames, June 2, 1765:

<blockquote>

<p>In my Passage to America, I read your excellent Work, the Elements
of Criticism, in which I found great Entertainment, much to admire,
and nothing to reprove. I only wish'd you had examin'd more fully the
Subject of Music, and demonstrated that the Pleasure Artists feel in
hearing much of that compos'd in the modern Taste, is not the natural
Pleasure arising from Melody or Harmony of Sounds, but of the same
kind with the Pleasure we feel on seeing the surprizing Feats of
Tumblers and Rope Dancers, who execute difficult Things.

<p>For my part, I take this to be really the Case and suppose it the
Reason why those who being unpractis'd in Music, and therefore
unacquainted with those Difficulties, have little or no Pleasure in
hearing this Music. Many Pieces of it are mere Compositions of Tricks.
I have sometimes at a Concert attended by a common Audience plac'd
myself so as to see all their Faces, and observ'd no Signs of Pleasure
in them during the Performance of much that was admir'd by the
Performers themselves; while a plain old Scottish Tune, which they
disdain'd and could scarcely be prevail'd on to play, gave manifest
and general Delight.

<p>Give me leave on this Occasion to extend a little the Sense of your
Position, That "Melody and Harmony are separately agreable, and in
Union delightful;" and to give it as my Opinion, that the Reason why
the Scotch Tunes have liv'd so long, and will probably live forever
(if they escape being stifled in modern affected Ornament) is merely
this, that they are really Compositions of Melody and Harmony united,
or rather that their Melody is Harmony. I mean the simple Tunes sung
by a single Voice. As this will appear paradoxical I must explain my
Meaning.

<p>In common Acceptation indeed, only an agreable Succession of Sounds
is called Melody, and only the Co-existence of agreeing Sounds,
Harmony. But since the Memory is capable of retaining for some Moments
a perfect Idea of the Pitch of a past Sound, so as to compare with it
the Pitch of a succeeding Sound, and judge truly of their Agreement or
Disagreement, there may and does arise from thence a Sense of Harmony
between present and past Sounds, equally pleasing with that between
two present Sounds.

<p>Now the Construction of the old Scotch Tunes is this, that almost
every succeeding emphatical Note, is a Third, a Fifth, an Octave, or
in short some Note that is in Concord with the preceding Note. Thirds
are chiefly used, which are very pleasing Concords. I use the Word
emphatical, to distinguish those Notes which have a Stress laid on
them in Singing the Tune, from the lighter connecting Notes, that
serve merely, like Grammar Articles, to tack the others together. That
we have a most perfect Idea of a Sound just past, I might appeal to
all acquainted with Music, who know how easy it is to repeat a Sound
in the same Pitch with one just heard.

<p>In Tuning an Instrument, a good Ear can as easily determine that
two Strings are in Unison, by sounding them separately, as by sounding
them together; their Disagreement is also as easily, I believe I may
say more easily and better distinguish'd, when sounded separately; for
when sounded together, tho' you know by the Beating that one is higher
than the other, you cannot tell which it is. Farther, when we consider
by whom these ancient Tunes were composed, and how they were first
performed, we shall see that such harmonical Succession of Sounds was
natural and even necessary in their Construction.

<p>They were compos'd by the Minstrels of those days, to be plaid on
the Harp accompany'd by the Voice. The Harp was strung with Wire, and
had no Contrivance like that in the modern Harpsichord, by which the
Sound of a preceding Note could be stopt the Moment a succeding Note
began. To avoid actual Discord it was therefore necessary that the
succeeding emphatic Note should be a Chord with the preceding, as
their Sounds must exist at the same time. Hence arose that Beauty in
those Tunes that has so long pleas'd, and will please for ever, tho'
Men scarce know why. That they were originally compos'd for the Harp,
and of the most simple kind, I mean a Harp without any Half Notes but
those in the natural Scale, and with no more than two Octaves of
Strings from C. to C.

<p>I conjecture from another Circumstance, which is, that not one of
those Tunes really ancient has a single artificial Half Note in it;
and that in Tunes where it was most convenient for the Voice, to use
the middle Notes of the Harp, and place the Key in F. there the
B. which if used should be a B flat, is always omitted by passing over
it with a Third.

<p>The Connoisseurs in modern Music will say I have no Taste, but I
cannot help adding, that I believe our Ancestors in hearing a good
Song, distinctly articulated, sung to one of those Tunes and
accompanied by the Harp, felt more real Pleasure than is communicated
by the generality of modern Operas, exclusive of that arising from the
Scenery and Dancing. Most Tunes of late Composition, not having the
natural Harmony united with their Melody, have recourse to the
artificial Harmony of a Bass and other accompanying Parts. This
Support, in my Opinion, the old Tunes do not need, and are rather
confus'd than aided by it. Whoever has heard James Oswald play them on
his Violoncello, will be less inclin'd to dispute this with me. I have
more than once seen Tears of Pleasure in the Eyes of his Auditors; and
yet I think even his Playing those Tunes would please more, if he gave
them less modern Ornament.

<h3 id=sec_7_1_1>7.1.1&nbsp; Scale As Theme: Melodic Association From Harmonic Association</h3>

<p>Further examination of songs reveals that melody is not quite just
arpeggio: within the melody line other notes from the same scale are
often thrown in that do not harmonize with the chord currently being
emphasized.  This is particularly obvious if one reads music written
in fake book [<span class="cite">Neely1999</span>] format.  In
contrast to the classical format, where every single note is written
out explicitly, in fake book format all that is presented of the music
is (1) a sequence of chords, and (2) a melody line.  Two forces seem
to be generating the notes that are actually played:<ul>

  <li> harmony associates some notes with one another and we therefore
expect them together, whereas

  <li> melody exhibits <ul>

    <li> a tendency to go "up and down" by consecutive or almost
    consecutive notes,

    <li>often traveling within the harmonic expectation of the current
    chord or scale, but sometimes not.

</ul></ul>
What is going on?

<p>Perhaps melody is arpeggio of an entire scale.  Recall that a scale
is generally not one chord but three triads (particularly powerful
chords) occurring together. Recall from our discussion of
<em>theme</em> in <a href='#sec_2_4_1'>Section 2.4.1</a> "The Simplicity of Theme" that any kind of
expectation is useful to the brain, not just those that are computable
from direct harmonic relationship.  Therefore it is possible that a
scale creates a weaker kind of association than (or containing) the
stronger harmonic association of the current chord.  Specifically, as
a scale is multiple chords, notes within a scale may be harmonically
far from one another and may instead be related simply by the fact
that that they are known to occur together, due to their frequent use
together to make harmonicly-related chords.

<p>Given the theme of a scale, we suggest that a general desire for
the melody line to go vaguely "up" or "down" will naturally create an
expectation for the "next" or "previous" note in the scale, regardless
of any direct harmonic relationship between the two notes. Let's call
this kind of association a "melodic association". Recall the first
page of the music theory book referred to above, "Jazz Improvisation
1: Tonal and Rhythmic Principles" by John Mehegan [<span
class="cite">Mehegan1959</span>], where Mehegan referred to harmonic
association as "vertical" and melodic association as "horizontal" (a
different notion of vertical and horizontal than we give in <a href='#sec_2_3_2'>Section 2.3.2</a> "Harmony Induces Two Kinds of Intervals: Horizontal Within the Note and Vertical Across the Notes").

<h3 id=sec_7_1_2>7.1.2&nbsp; Streaming: Multiple Similar Phenomenon Occurring Consecutively Are Explained By The Brain As One Thing Moving</h3>

<p>One of the first movies was created by a horse galloping through a
sequence of strings, each of which fired a camera when broken. When
the sequence of images taken was played back rapidly, people noticed
an illusion of a single horse moving, not multiple horses appearing
one after the other. Similar tones that are close enough and also
occur consecutively seem to produce a similar effect in the brain.
From [<span class="cite">acoustical-demo, Demo 19</span>], "Pitch
Streaming" (emphasis in the original):

<blockquote>

<p>It is clear in listening to melodies that sequences of tone can
form coherent patterns. This is called <em>temporal coherence</em>.
When tones do not form patterns, but seem isolated, that is called
<em>fission</em>.

<p>Temporal coherence and fission are illustrated in a demonstration
first presented by van Noorden (1975) and included in the "Harvard
Tapes" (1978). Van Noorden describes it as a "galloping rhythm."

<p>We present tones A and B in the sequence ABA ABA. Tone A has a
frequency of of 2000 Hz, tone B varies from 1000 to 4000 Hz and back
again to 1000 Hz. Near the crossover points, the tones appear to form
a coherent patterns, characterized by a galloping rhythm, but at large
intervals the tones seem isolated, illustrating fission.

</blockquote>

<p>This demo supports my conjecture at the end of the article that,
while there is "harmonic locality" to pitches that sound good
together, there is also a "melodic locality" to pitches that are near
each other, which is why melodies tend to be close notes going up and
down.

<p>Simon Goldsmith [<span class="cite">Goldsmith, c. 2010</span>]
suggests that some natural phenomena are well-modeled this way, such a
horse galloping on plain or raindrops on a tree: that is, it seems
natural to associate similar pitches as they tend to come from the
same physical phenomenon.

<h3 id=sec_7_1_3>7.1.3&nbsp; Melody can Easily Create Interesting Ambiguities</h3>

<p>Melody can easily create interesting ambiguities even between
multiple chords none of which are ambiguous when played together.
That is, melody can be used to play ambiguity games with chords,
extending the effect that we noticed earlier in <a href='#sec_2_4_2'>Section 2.4.2</a> "The Complexity of Ambiguity": if I play two notes and your brain is
expecting them to complete a chord, there are still many that it could
complete, even if none of these chords are the strange chords given in
<a href='#sec_3_5_4'>Section 3.5.4</a> "Chords Inducing Ambiguity".  Doing this certainly gives the
disambiguation and prediction engine in your brain something to do.

<h2 id=sec_7_2_0>7.2&nbsp; The Role of Narrative Generally</h2>

<p>Recall our conjectures on the importance of theme and ambiguity
from <a href='#sec_2_4_0'>Section 2.4</a> "Interestingness: Just Enough Complexity".  How might
<em>theme</em> and <em>ambiguity</em> play out as information is added
<em>over time</em>, and what would we call that?

<p>Since anticipation and prediction is one of the fundamental
operations of the brain, they are at the heart of what we call
<em>narrative</em> and how narrative can be so entertaining the mind.
Recall that there is an art to balancing the simplicity of theme and
the complexity of ambiguity: if understanding and prediction of the
storyline are too easy, then it is boring, and if too hard, then it is
noise, but if just right, then it is interesting.

<p>That is, it is likely that the brain has one disambiguation engine
and that the processing that occurs in verbal narrative would process
similarly in other contexts, such as music.  Above in <a href='#sec_3_5_6'>Section 3.5.6</a> "Chords Preserving Intervals but not Harmonics" we mentioned some chords that
are hard to explain in isolation.  Well these chords do sound strange
in isolation, however the theme created by the preceding music before
the chord may bring a certain sense to them.  Think of one standard
structure for a joke: a story (creating a theme) and then a punchline;
the punchline would not be funny in isolation without the context
provided by the story, and yet we attribute the funniness of the joke
to the punchline and not the story which did the work.

<p>Recently while listening to the rhythm of an insect at twilight I
was struck by how the rhythm occured in layers of declining theme and
increasing complexity: there was a simple rhythm creating an
expectation, and then regular a violation of that expectation,
creating a rhythm on top of that.  This phenomenon of narrative, of
anticipation and prediction within a theme, applies to both harmony
and rhythm.  The phenomenon of expectation itself is likely generic
across kinds of inputs and so harmonic expectation should work in a
similarly layered manner as rhythmic expectation.

<p>Keith Johnstone is a genius of the narrative form who helped create
modern improvisational acting.  Below he points out below that the
duality of theme versus ambiguity is at the heart of what makes
stories work when he says "What matters to me is the ease with which I
free-associate and the skill with which I reincorporate."  Notice that
"free-associat[ing]" implies that he has created ambiguity
(hard-to-model complexity) and the "reincorporat[ing]" implies that he
resolves the ambiguity, creating a theme.  This two-part process of
creating ambiguity and the resolving to theme repeats and layers in
real stories, previously-created themes being used as context for the
upcoming ambiguities.

<p>From "Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre" by Keith Johnstone
[<span class="cite">Johnstone1981, p. 112-113</span>], (emphasis in
the original):

<blockquote>

<p>Suppose I make up a story about meeting a bear in the forest.  It
chases me until I come to a lake.  I leap into a boat and row across
to an island.  On the island is a hut.  In the hut is a beautiful girl
spinning golden thread.  I make passionate love to the girl...

<p>I am now storytelling but I haven't told a <em>story</em>.
Everyone knows it isn't finished.  I could continue forever in the
same way....

<p>The trouble with such a sequence is that there's no place where it
can stop, or rather, that it can stop <em>anywhere</em>; you are
unconsciously waiting for another activity to start, not free
association, but <em>reincorporation</em>.

<p>... What matters to me is the ease with which I free-associate and
the skill with which I reincorporate.

<p>Here's a 'good night' story made up by me and Dorcas (age six).

<br>'What do you want a story about?' I asked.

<br>'A little bird,' she said.

<br>'That's right.  And where did this little bird live?'

<br>'With Mummy and Daddy bird.'

<br>'Mummy and Daddy looked out of the nest one day and saw a man
coming through the trees.  What did he have in his hand?'

<br>'An axe.'

<br>'And he took the axe and started chopping down all the trees with
a white mark on.  So Daddy bird flew out of the nest, and do you know
what he saw on the bark of his tree?'

<br>'A white mark.

<br>'Which meant?'

<br>'The man was going to cut down their tree.'

<br>'So the birds all flew down to the river.  Who did they meet?'

<br>'Mr Elephant.'

<br>'Yes.  And Mr Elephant filled his trunk with water and washed the
white mark away from the tree.  And what did he do with the water left
in his trunk?'

<br>'He squirted it over the man.'

<br>'That's right.  And he chased the man right out of the forest and
the man never came back.'

<br>'And is that the end of the story?'

<br>'It is.'

<p>At the age of six she has a better understanding of storytelling
than many university students.  She links the man to the birds by
giving him an axe.  She links up the water left in the trunk with the
wood-cutter, who she remembers we'd shelved.  She isn't concerned with
content but any narrative will have some (about insecurity, I
suppose).

</blockquote>

<h2 id=sec_7_3_0>7.3&nbsp; Embodiment and Emotion</h2>

<p>Where does the emotion of music come from?  Many people are asking
what I consider to be a similar question: where does the meaning of
sentences come from?

<p>The best answer I have heard to this question is "Embodied
Construction Grammars" [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_grammar">con</a>]. The
idea is that words and grammatical constructions in sentences are
associated <em>directly</em> to an <em>embodied</em> experience. From
[<span class="cite">Feldman2006, p. 7</span>] (emphasis in the
original):

<blockquote>

<p><strong>The Embodied Mind</strong>

<p>One simple insight has driven much of the scientific study of how
the structure and function of the brain results in thought and
language.  Human language and thought are crucially shaped by the
properties of our bodies and the structure of our physical and social
environment.  Language and thought are not best studied as formal
mathematics and logic, but as adaptations that enable creatures like
us to thrive in a wide range of situations....

<p>The embodied approach entails several crucial questions.  How much,
and in exactly what ways, are thought and language products of our
bodies?  How, exactly, does our embodied nature shape the way we think
and communicate?  Here are some of the findings discussed in the
course of this book:<ul>

<li>Concrete words and concepts directly label our embodied experience.
Think of of such short words in English as <em>knee</em>,
<em>kick</em>, <em>ask</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>want</em>,
<em>sad</em>.

<li>Spatial relations, for example, concepts directly expressed by
words such as <em>in</em>, <em>through</em>, <em>above</em>, and
<em>around</em>, can be seen as derived form specialized circuitry in
the visual system: topographic maps of the visual field,
orientation-sensitive cells.

<li>What is technically called "aspect" in linguistics -- the way we
conceptualize the structure of events, reason about events, and
express events in language -- appears to stem from the neural
structure of our system of motor control.

<li>Abstract thought grows out of concrete embodied experiences,
typically sensory-motor experiences.  Much of abstract thought makes
use of reasoning based on the underlying embodied experience....

<li>Grammar consists of neural circuitry pairing embodied concepts with
sound (or sign).  Grammar is not a separate faculty, but depends on
embodied conceptual and phonological systems....

</ul>

<p>Thought and language are thus very strongly shaped by the nature of
our bodies, our brains, and our experience functioning in the everyday
world....

<p>Thoughts and language are not disembodied symbol systems that
happen to be realized in the human brain though its computational
properties.  Instead, thought and language are inherently embodied.
They reflect the structure of human bodies and have the inherent
properties of neural systems as well as the external physical and
social environment.

</blockquote>

<p>And further [<span class="cite">Feldman2006, p. 213</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Understanding as Simulation</strong>

<p>... The important point for us is that much of language can be seen
as setting up the conditions for imagining the scene being portrayed.

</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we need an "embodied construction grammar" for music:<ul>

  <li>Harmony as an abstraction of human voice.

  <li>Rhythm as an abstraction of physical movement, such as walking
      or dance (which we discuss more in the rhythm section below).

</ul>

<p>Since much human relationship is expressed through voice and
movement, is music therefore recalling to us experiences of vocally
and physically relating to others and therefore also recalling the
associated emotions?

<p>As Zen Buddhists say, while on the one hand, "mind and body are
two", on the other hand "mind and body are one". (Maddeningly) though
I have heard the non-dualism of body and mind expressed often in Zen
(it is quite standard), I have given up on trying to find a citation
for that exact pair of sentences. Here is a pretty good statement of
the sentiment by Shunryu Suzuki in "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind", [<span
class="cite">Suzuki1970, Epilogue: Zen Mind</span>]:

<blockquote>

<p>We Buddhists do not have any idea of material only, or mind only,
or the products of our mind, or mind as an attribute of being. What we
are always talking about is that mind and body, mind and material are

<h2 id=sec_7_4_0>7.4&nbsp; A Proposal For A Unifying Physical and Computational Theory of Music</h2>

<p><strong>Harmony as Abstract Voice</strong>: In sum, we have the
following theory of what is compelling about harmony.

<ul>

  <li>Embodiment: The voice is of great importance to humans as it is
  one primary way of relating to each other.  Emotion is our ancient,
  pre-intellectual, way of understanding each other and therefore much
  emotion is communicated in voice.  It is likely that the brain has
  much hardware devoted to processing voice, both for finding signal
  and separating out noise, and this hardware is being repurposed when
  listening to music.

  <li>Abstraction: The Harmonic Series is an abstraction of voice.
  The features that occur as the artifacts of its processing can be
  fired off by artists in clever ways beyond those that occur in
  nature.  These manipulations of the features of harmony produce
  manipulations of the human response to voice, namely emotion.

  <li>Complexity: Discovering a theme in some input is a way to manage
  the complexity of the input.  Likely layers of theme and the
  resulting unexplained residual complexity are being processed by an
  expectation engine in the brain.  Much of the art of manipulating
  harmony is simply playing with this expectation engine, giving it
  just enough complexity so the input remains on the interesting
  border between monotony and noise.

</ul>

<p><strong>Rhythm as Abstract Movement</strong>: This phenomenon of
the joy of just-interesting-enough anticipation and prediction
connects thinking about harmony and rhythm.  We did not take up rhythm
in depth in this article, however I think it is quite likely that
rhythm can be explained in a manner similar to harmony. <ul>

  <li>Embodiment: Regular moments of contact occur throughout our
  lives while we use our bodies, for example in our breathing,
  heart-beating, speaking, and walking.

  <li>Abstraction: Just as the Harmonic Series is an abstraction of
  voice, rhythm is an abstraction of coordinated body movement.

  <li>Complexity: Just as melody plays with the expectation of
  harmony, rhythm plays with the expectation of movement.

</ul>

<p><strong>Melody as the Narrative Unifying of Harmony and
Rhythm</strong>: Finally, we see melody as the unification of Harmony
and Rhythm as a single narrative, intertwining both.

<p>I gratefully acknowledge the proofreading of Simon Goldsmith, Mark
Hoemmen, Emma Dzelzkalns, Peter McCorquodale, Ryan Barrett, Karl Chen,
Russell Sears, and Michael O'Donnell.  Thanks also to Michelle and
others at the Art and Music Department of the Central Berkeley Public
Library for their assistance finding Helmholtz and checking a quote
over the phone.  Thanks also to Joanne of The 24/7 Reference
Cooperative and John Kupersmith of the University of California,
Berkeley Library for help in finding the obscure Terhardt and Gerson &
Goldstein articles.  Thanks to the people who pointed out to me that
the first version of this article used "sustained" for the chord that
is "correctly" known as "suspended".  Thanks to the reader who asked
for further thinking on so-called "undertones".

<p>I have to particularly acknowledge Michael O'Donnell for his
extensive and in-depth discussions with me on the topic of this paper.
He also recommended to me the "Auditory Demonstrations" CD [<span
class="cite">acoustical-demo</span>], which certainly extended my
understanding of the details of what is known about how the brain
processes sound. Mike has genuine enthusiasm for and knowledge of the
subject of how the brain listens to music. He was quite generous in
sharing that knowledge with me by providing much thoughtful and
thorough feedback. Thanks Mike.

<p>Any remaining errors are mine alone.
